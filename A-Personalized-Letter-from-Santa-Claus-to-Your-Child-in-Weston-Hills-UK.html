      Santa Mail is the original and the largest site on the web for personalized letters from Santa Clause for 3 years running! Streamlined and re-organized some sections to help readability. 
      The name Santa Claus is believed to be derived from Saint Nicholas, the national saint of Russia, Greece, Apulia, Sicily and Lorraine. It is in the brief December season that Americans, using the language and objects of their culture, recapture ideals and act according to their better selves. 
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? But for most Americans his most popular name would become Santa Claus.
