      Nicholas as the patron saint of New York in his book, The History of New York. This page is part of the $10,000 Money Making Mama Challenge. 
      The legend is based on the tales concerning the historical figure of gift giver Saint Nicholas. There is a crocodile dubbed Gustave, who has allegedly killed around 300 people. (I personally believe 300 is a hyped number and the true number might be around 100, but yikes, that’s a lot).

      Nicholas was famous for his generous gifts to the poor, in particular presenting the three impoverished daughters of a pious Christian with dowries so that they would not have to become prostitutes.[8] He was very religious from an early age and devoted his life entirely to Christianity. In that age (and ours) of material wealth and rational discourse, the ascetic saints of Christianity held no wide appeal, hut Santa allowed one to give and get and also to believe. 
      His history of Saint Nicholas is thorough and the look at Santa’s first 100 years is pretty thorough. Previous letters can be used by children as a basis for writing their most recent letter to Santa and even used as a start point for writing a Christmas morning letter to Santa to thank him for all the wonderful new toys they received. 
      See how easy it is to create a free letter from Santa and feel your heart warm as your child gets the biggest Christmas smile of all on their face.
