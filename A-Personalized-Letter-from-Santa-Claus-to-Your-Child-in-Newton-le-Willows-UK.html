Dear {NAME}, I look forward to Christmas all year long because I love visiting little children all over the world and bringing them gifts. 
      With just a little creativity and some careful planning, you can put presents under the tree like a pro in no time. The Original Letter from Santa is truly an heirloom that will be packed away from year to year, handed down to that special child when they have a home of their own. 
      Your Santa letters probably get sent here randomly since it is, Santa's House in North Pole. Do not take this occupation as nonsense or trivia. 
      I think when it's open, you can pay to get closer to the reindeer, but we could still see them from outside of the fence.

      In addition, on the Internet, you can also find many different sites where you can leave your message for the Wizard. The names may be different, but there were enough similarities between all these symbolic personages to allow, by the early 20th century, Father Christmas, Santa, St Nick and others to merge. 
      With all of his reindeer to care for, Santa is certainly an animal lover, and he hasn't forgotten the family pet: special versions of the Original Letter from Santa are even available for that special pampered family dog or cat. For Santa to do his work, he must secretly slip in and out of a home. 
      Let him or her put it into an envelope addressed simply “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE.”  Later, secretly open the letter and write a response from Santa. USPS suggests writing it on the back of your child’s letter so he or she can see the original along with Santa’s response. “When responding as Santa, make the response as personal as possible by highlighting your child’s accomplishments over the past year,” USPS suggests. “For example, helping around the house, receiving good grades in a particular subject at school or participating in community service activities.” Then, put it in an envelope addressed to your child with “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE” as the return address.  Add the proper postage ― USPS suggests one of its new holiday-themed stamps ― then put it inside a larger envelope, also with the necessary postage. In 2007, artist David Choe made North Pole, Alaska his final destination of Thumbs Up!, Season 2. 
      You may also want to invest in display advertising in your local newspaper or, if you can afford it, in a national parenting magazine.

      2 months ago • Reply walt1975 1 lousy hours rude unhelpful staff mail wasn't delivered all winter due to being on a "contract route " and if there is the slightest bit of snow the contractor doesn't have to deliver. which means for those of us that work for a living during normal hours only get mail if you go and get it on Saturday during their rather short hours of business as closing at 5 makes it almost impossible to get there by close.

As for this Christmas, I have already gone over budget and have only bought for a few people.  This year I bought for myself too (Lego time!).  Last year I bought myself the Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi.  For this year I was going to buy myself a higher end camera but instead settled on buying myself a lot of Lego train items (beware, Lego is suppose to be doing away with the 9 volt Lego trains).

      A Santa Clause letters business can be started inexpensively, with little more than your imagination. Of course the most fundamental rule would seem to be that a carol has a religious connotation related to the birth of Christ, and yet some pieces which today are usually thought of as carols actually relate to quite different events in the Bible, or contain secular themes, whilst other pieces which are usually thought of as pop songs may carry a clear religious message.
