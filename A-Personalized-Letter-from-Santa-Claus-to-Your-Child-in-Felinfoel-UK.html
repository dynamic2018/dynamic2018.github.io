      Santa answers every letter that is sent to him, but he has so much mail it usually takes him about three days to write back to you. The celestial pole will be nearest Polaris in 2100 and will thereafter become more distant.[7] Due to the precession of the equinoxes (as well as the stars' proper motions), the role of North Star has passed (and will pass) from one star to another in the remote past (and in the remote future).
