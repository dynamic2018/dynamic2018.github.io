      Thus was born the outdoor light show, which still burns brightly in towns across America. Then when I say "Good-by and a merry Christmas to my little Susy Clemens," you must say "Good-by, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much." Then you must go down into the library and make George close all the doors that open into the main hall, and everybody must keep still for a little while.

      You'll mail back a letter from Santa Claus that goes directly to the child.
