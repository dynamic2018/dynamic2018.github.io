      Children love to receive these letters and with the templates over at Free Santa Letters, they only take a few minutes to create. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?

      Nicholas was a historic 4th-century Greek saint (from an area now in modern day Turkey) who had a reputation for secret gift-giving, such as putting coins in the shoes left out for him. But as the community grew so did the store, and they added Christmas treasures, a new wing, and the world's largest Santa that stands 42-feet-tall. 
      Nicholas had an earlier merging with the Grandmother cult in Bari, Italy where the grandmother would put gifts in stockings. Where I grew up, Santa visited every Christmas Eve, right after dinner. 
      Good luck on getting your children's personalized letter service started!
