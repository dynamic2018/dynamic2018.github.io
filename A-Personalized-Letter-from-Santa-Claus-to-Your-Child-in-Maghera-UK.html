      George must not use a broom, but a rag--else he will die someday. Santa can even sign his name on the cards, or have the entire card written in his handwriting. 
      Research other Santa letter services to find out what the going rate is for a Santa letter, and keep your pricing competitive based on that information. By the 1850s, many Americans, not just New Englanders, had fallen in love with the German custom. 
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? Itʼs also possible that your computer has been infected with a Spambot virus thatʼs using your computer to gather information. 
      Having realized how important it is for children to receive computers, tablets and touch phones as a gift, Santa Claus has long created his email address. Don’t forget to wrap presents from Santa in a completely different kind of paper than you use for other gifts. 
      Encourage your child to view as you print and say the letters out loud.

      Another way to determine which melon to buy is by looking at the melon's color. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!)
