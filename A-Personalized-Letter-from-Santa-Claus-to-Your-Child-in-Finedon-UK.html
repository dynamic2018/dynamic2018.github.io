A Father Christmas-like character, dressed in green, appears as the Ghost of Christmas Present in Charles Dickens’s 1843 A Christmas Carol.  He joins forces with the spirits of Christmas Past and Christmas Future to show Scrooge that, “while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humor.”  Santa Claus may get his heft from consuming all the midnight snacks offered by children all over the world. 
      In the United Kingdom, Father Christmas was historically depicted wearing a green cloak.[citation needed] As Father Christmas has been increasingly merged into the image of Santa Claus, that has been changed to the more commonly known red suit.[120] One school in the seaside town of Brighton banned the use of a red suit erroneously believing it was only indicative of the Coca-Cola advertising campaign.

What is Santa's address? He comes from the North, so why not reindeer?  In Scandinavia and Germany Santa comes on the 24th of December, knocking on the door like normal people.

These include requiring donors to present a photo ID when they pick up Santa letters, and redacting the children’s full names and addresses—assigning each letter a number and storing the delivery info in a database that only the postal employees who actually deliver the gifts can access. “It was different in every place it was done—some only had a letter-response campaign where they would send form letters out to the kids, there was no gift giving,” says Fontana. “In New York, we send only the gifts.” It’s a much more modern approach to playing Santa than Fanny Longfellow or John Gluck could have imagined. 
      This time, she heard a man’s voice: “This is how we can keep the Holocaust alive,” he said. “We can bury you without touching you.” When Gersh put down the phone, her hands were shaking.
