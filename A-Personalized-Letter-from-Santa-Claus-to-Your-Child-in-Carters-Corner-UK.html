DS "This article helped me by giving me a straight As on my grade.A Grumpy Old Elf answers your questions about writing a letter to Santa Claus: How do I write a letter to Santa? 
      Perhaps you can use Santa’s seeds to discuss the importance of care and nurture. Santa is implied to be not human but a spirit like the Spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Future shown to be authentic in that episode.

      My daughter did enjoy this story with me, see that Santa is for real and he truly is magical. This celebration, referred to as Las Posadas, lasts from December 16 until Christmas Eve on December 24. 
      In the evenings, Dutch Children sing songs in front of the fire place or in the living room and leave their shoe with a present (drawing for Sinterklaas and Zwarte Piet or a Carrot for Amerigo Sinterklaas' horse) In the mornings they will find their shoe filled with candy and small presents. And adults do a great job of duping them.[123] —  Jacqueline Wooley Woolley posited that it is perhaps "kinship with the adult world" that causes children not to be angry that they were lied to for so long.[123] However, the criticism about this deception is not that it is a simple lie, but a complicated series of very large lies.[124] Objections include that it is unethical for parents to lie to children without good cause, and that it discourages healthy skepticism in children.[124] With no greater good at the heart of the lie, some have charged that it is more about the parents than it is about the children.

      Upon hearing of the old man’s plight Nicholas anonymously tossed bags of gold into stockings hanging in the man’s house over three consecutive nights.
