      Earth’s imaginary north polar axis extends into space in the direction of the North Star (Polaris). The bill that passed the House and Senate, and which President William Howard Taft signed that March, eschewed the word "discovery," crediting Peary only with "Arctic exploration resulting in [his] reaching the North Pole." But he was placed on the retired list of the Navy's Corps of Civil Engineers with the rank of rear admiral and given a pension of $6,000 annually. 
      Much of Santa Claus's mythos was not set in stone at the time, leaving Baum to give his "Neclaus" (Necile's Little One) a wide variety of immortal support, a home in the Laughing Valley of Hohaho, and ten reindeer—who could not fly, but leapt in enormous, flight-like bounds.

      I'm probably going to do the same thing with my twins.  G GlksBaby @ld8569 In my childhood Christmas was more about family than Santa, Christmas Eve was always the bigger deal (Italian...the fishes) and the gifts we got from each other/parents/grandparents were always the best gifts (like a bike would be a gift from my parents).

What is Santa's address? 
      Writing a letter to Santa is a super fun Christmas tradition.Before the vote, he wrote on Facebook:  I am an Alaska state-registered medical cannabis patient (Cannabidiol) and have successfully been taking the oil to treat my cancer diagnosed 4 years ago. 
      But it takes a lot MORE magic to do it without a key, and on Christmas Even he needs every bit of Christmas spirit to make sure the reindeer and sleigh can make it all around the world.) So now, any time Santa wants to get into a home without a chimney (and even some homes WITH chimneys because it's so much easier to go through the door), he simply looks for a special key left near the door or hanging around the doorknob with a note for him. 87 Favourite Favourited   Add to Added   Personalised Vintage Letter From Santa Father Christmas & Nice List Certificate SimplyScrolls 5 out of 5 stars (161) £1.

      Sometime between 1830 and 1840, Schmid's poem and Schulz's melody were united in the Friedrich Heinrich Eickhoff songbook, 'Sixty German Songs for Thirty Pennies'.This date was earlier than the original day of gifts for the children, which moved in the course of the Reformation and its opposition to the veneration of saints in many countries on the 24 and 25 December. 
      He doesn't get back there as often any more.  But, I figured you'd want to know about it anyway, otherwise you'd be grumpy with me. This is especially good for young children who may have a hard time writing a letter on their own.   Templates also make the letters look a bit more festive since they usually incorporate holiday-inspired imagery.
