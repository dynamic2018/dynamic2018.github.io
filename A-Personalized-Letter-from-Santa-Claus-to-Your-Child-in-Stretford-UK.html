      Can you remember what it felt like when you were a child to receive something in the mail? Because archaeologists sometimes have a sense of humour, it was christened Sanctacaris – Santa Claws.   And yes, before you ask, sea scorpions in all their glory, and considerably bigger even than Jaek, will be making their appearance at some point in the Empire series. 
      Nick— particularly Thomas Nast’s 1871 depiction in the widely read Harper’s Weekly magazine —sorting letters from “Good Children’s Parents” and “Naughty Children’s Parents”— helped spread the idea of sending Santa mail. A real estate representative selling him property in Oklahoma first gave him a suit about three years ago and Collins was talked into playing Santa for a visit to a preschool and a high school football game.

      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!

      A few days later—on April 6, 1909—at the end of an exhausting day's march, Henson, who could not use a sextant, had a "feeling" they were at the pole, he later told the Boston American. "We are now at the Pole, are we not?" Henson said he asked Peary. "I do not suppose that we can swear that we are exactly at the Pole," Peary replied, according to Henson.
