      This letter should be individualized and may include children's innermost dreams and desires. In one episode of Mike the Knight, Mike tries to deliver the presents for Santa to get off the naughty list, not realizing he was never on the naughty list, it's just that his present was very big and so hadn't been delivered yet. 
      Santa's secret home was revealed in 1927 on the popular Finnish Children's Hour radio show by Uncle Markus, Markus Rautio.  Uncle Markus explained about the special mountain called Korvatunturi or Ear Mountain.  The mountain looks like a big set of rabbit ears.  Of course, the elves figured out long ago how to use the ears to listen to which children around the world were being naughty.  Mora,Sweden Another one of Santa's homes is near Mora, Sweden.  Of course, he usually goes by his Swedish name there, Jultomten, or Christmas elf. The music of this ballet has become a tradition at Christmas time in the United States and it is featured in telecasts, video, and radio. 
      Too bad he never takes the elves (but I think I'd melt in Spain anyway). Then when I say “Good bye and a merry Christmas to my little Susie Clemens,” you must say “Good bye, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much and please tell that little Snow Flake I will look at her star tonight and she must look down here—I will be right in the west bay window; and every fine night I will look at her star and say, ‘I know somebody up there and likeher, too.'” Then you must go down into the library and make George close all the doors that open into the main hall, and everybody must keep still for a little while. 
      It is said that he gave away all of his inherited wealth and traveled the countryside helping the poor and sick.

Buy Soon newspapers across the country were reporting the arrival of Santa letters to local postal departments, and then to their own offices (recognizing the emotional power of the letters, many papers published the children’s scrawls and even offered prizes for the “best” letters). “The little folks are getting interested about Christmas,” wrote a reporter for Columbia, South Carolina’s Daily Phoenix in December 1873. 
      MAUD LINDSAY, "Santa Claus, a Wonder Story for Little Children" 16 likes Tags: Maud Lindsay Santa Claus is anyone who loves another and seeks to make them happy; who gives himself by thought or word or deed in every gift that he bestows; who shares his joys with those who are sad; whose hand is never closed against the needy; whose arm is ever outstretched to aid the weak; whose sympathy is quick and genuine in time of trouble; who recognizes a comrade and brother in every man he meets upon life's common road; who lives his life throughout the entire year in the Christmas spirit.
