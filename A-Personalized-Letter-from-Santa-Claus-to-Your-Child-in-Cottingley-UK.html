      Although it may not seem like it now, this Santa hasn’t always been around. By some accounts, Santa Claus and Father Christmas are separate beings, though they may share similar magical origins.[3] On one particular Christmas Eve, a thick fog settled over the North Pole, seriously hampering visibility. 
      There are some tough words and names and places that kids just won't be able to pronounce or understand. For a while, Ilya Salkind actively pursued Carroll O'Connor for the role before Szwarc showed him David Huddleston's screen-test, which won Salkind over.

      But, When Christmas Eve turned foggy and Santa worried that he wouldn’t be able to deliver gifts that night, the former outcast saved Christmas by leading the sleigh by the light of his red nose. Before the show aired, Blain hired two more "elves" to boost her staff of 10, because she knew that companies featured on Shark Tank typically receive a great response.

The jolly, chubby, grandfatherly face of this Santa was largely created by Thomas Nast, the great political cartoonist in an era that featured many. "However, Nast did leave him half-sized," Bowler added, "and in what I think are rather indecent long johns." Once firmly established, North America's Santa then underwent a kind of reverse migration to Europe, replacing the scary gift bringers and adopting local names like Père Noël (France) or Father Christmas (Great Britain). "What he's done is pretty much tame these Grimm's Fairy Tales-type characters from the late medieval days," Bowler said. (Related: "Real Christmas Trees Save Water.")
