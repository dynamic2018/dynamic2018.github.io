"You still love your kids, but now who is going to bring them the gifts?" Bowler said that, in many cases, that job fell to baby Jesus, and the date was moved to Christmas rather than December 6.

"So the Christ child was often given a scary helper to do the lugging of presents and the threatening of kids that doesn't seem appropriate coming from the baby Jesus." Some of these scary Germanic figures again were based on Nicholas, no longer as a saint but as a threatening sidekick like Ru-klaus (Rough Nicholas), Aschenklas (Ashy Nicholas), and Pelznickel (Furry Nicholas).
