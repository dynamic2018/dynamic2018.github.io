      Sneak Peak at Next Week Like learning about santa clause letters? Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      A common variation is to have Santa portrayed as not a single magical being, but as a god-like office held by a mortal, such as Ernest Saves Christmas, where Santa is a normal person who spends a large chunk of his (possibly magically lengthened) lifespan as Santa Claus, then passes the title off to someone else. As the child of the family holding a posada, she will be able to have her own posada for the children, with an accompanying piñata which she is ever so excited to pick out.

      Santa authentic down to 13-year-old beard By Dan Rice, Staff Writer After thirty-two round trips on the Alaska Highway, a 29-year stint as a cook at Clear Air Force Station and more than 40 years in Alaska, Collie Collins seems the proudest about another enduring aspect of himself. "That's real; that's 13 years old," he said to a visitor of the Santa Claus House in North Pole last week who couldn't resist testing whether Santa's beard is just part of a costume. In the English and later British colonies of North America, and later in the United States, British and Dutch versions of the gift-giver merged further.
