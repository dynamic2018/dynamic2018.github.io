By 1856 a northern provincial newspaper contained an advert alluding casually to them,[40] as well as reporting the accidental death of a woman whose dress caught fire as she lit the tapers on a Christmas tree.[41] They had not yet spread down the social scale though, as a report from Berlin in 1858 contrasts the situation there where "Every family has its own" with that of Britain, where Christmas trees were still the preserve of the wealthy or the "romantic".[42] Their use at public entertainments, charity bazaars and in hospitals made them increasingly familiar however, and in 1906 a charity was set up specifically to ensure even poor children in London slums 'who had never seen a Christmas tree' would enjoy one that year.[43] Anti-German sentiment after World War I briefly reduced their popularity[44] but the effect was short-lived[45] and by the mid-1920s the use of Christmas trees had spread to all classes.[46] In 1933 a restriction on the importation of foreign trees led to the 'rapid growth of a new industry' as the growing of Christmas trees within Britain became commercially viable due to the size of demand.[47] By 2013 the number of trees grown in Britain for the Christmas market was approximately 8 million[48] and their display in homes, shops and public spaces a normal part of the Christmas season.

Postal Service launched Letters to Santa earlier this month. 
      They tell him if they have been naughty or nice and what they want for Christmas. The laughter of Santa Claus has long been an important attribute by which the character is identified, but it also does not appear in many non-English-speaking countries.
