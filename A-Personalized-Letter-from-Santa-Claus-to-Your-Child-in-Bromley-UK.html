      When sent to the above address, letters are distributed through the program Operation Santa. Leave it there always in memory of my visit; and whenever you look at it or show it to anybody you must let it remind you to be a good little girl. 
      Then when I say "Good-by and a merry Christmas to my little Susy Clemens," you must say "Good-by, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much." Then you must go down into the library and make George close all the doors that open into the main hall, and everybody must keep still for a little while. Unbeknownst to many, Santa actually has to use many sleighs and fake Santa drivers to get the job done Christmas Eve, and the transportation management system (TMS) optimally builds thousands of consolidated sacks that maximize cube utilization and minimize total air miles.[44] In the cartoon base, Santa has been voiced by several people, including Stan Francis, Mickey Rooney, Ed Asner, John Goodman, and Keith Wickham. 
      As with most Magic Feathers, though, they do encourage characters to realize the potential that was inside them the whole time. Once the Alaskan post office receives the envelope, the home-addressed letter is removed from inside, post marked from the North Pole, and mailed back home. 
      Each parent should tell his child beforehand where and how Santa Claus lives. Its flesh is pale green to white in color and has a succulent texture with a mildly sweet flavor. 
      Help them write a letter to Santa that includes whether they've been "good," "very, very good" or "a teeny, tiny bit not so good" and three desired toys.

      On 23 December 2008, Jason Kenney, Canada's minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, formally awarded Canadian citizenship status to Santa Claus. "The Government of Canada wishes Santa the very best in his Christmas Eve duties and wants to let him know that, as a Canadian citizen, he has the automatic right to re-enter Canada once his trip around the world is complete," Kenney said in an official statement.[5] There is also a city named North Pole in Alaska where a tourist attraction known as the "Santa Claus House" has been established.
