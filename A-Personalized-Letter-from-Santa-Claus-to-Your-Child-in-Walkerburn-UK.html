      If you would prefer your business to have a more traditional letter-type approach, and you would like to add stickers and reindeer poop to your letters instead of photos of the children, then this would be a better option for you. In addition, Christmas is renamed "Frostmas", the elves are miserable (unlike the happy, productive workers they were when Scott was in charge), and all the reindeer are confined to a petting zoo.  Scott eventually finds Lucy and Neil, although they too are not happy to see him. 
      Scott manages to get them to "Canada" with the help of the Sandman. Your browser may also contain add-ons that send automated requests to our search engine.
