      He maintains that Santa can do whatever he wants, and unwrapping gifts is part of the fun of Christmas. In England, a Shropshire priest later recorded 25 of these carols in popular repertoires which were sung by 'wassailers' - people who entertained in the streets by visiting houses and communally singing for a reward of gifts, or food and drink. (Originally wassailers may have sung pagan songs to drive away evil spirits, but in the Christian world, they became the forerunners of modern day carol singers.) One of the oldest songs from this time is 'The Boar's Head Carol', of 1521, traditionally sung as a boar's head was presented on the table at a Tudor Christmas feast.
