      Then when I say "Good-by and a merry Christmas to my little Susy Clemens," you must say "Good-by, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much." Then you must go down into the library and make George close all the doors that open into the main hall, and everybody must keep still for a little while. Santas helpers work very hard to ensure that the magic of christmas is not lost. 
      Why can't I place my order online/my cart empties when I try to finish my order? The rest are from myself and DH, siblings, and various other family members that are wrapped and under the tree (or near the tree).

      Nicholas soon would be there;   The children were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads; And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, Had just settled down for a long winter's nap, When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. Because of a legal technicality known as "the Santa clause," Scott inherits the jolly old elf's job. 
      The modern practice of the hanging of stockings at the chimney in some homes may have derived from this tradition. I show the free Santa labels here on brown wrapping paper but they would really stand out if you were to put them on white wrapping paper or red & white paper.
