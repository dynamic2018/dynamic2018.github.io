The editorial, which included the famous reply "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus", has become an indelible part of popular Christmas lore in the United States and Canada. 
      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!A letter from Santa Claus December 5, 2007 – 7:23 pm I have a daughter who is a solid 6 years old.  She’s very loving and polite and her belief in things her parents tell her is whole-hearted.  So when mommy and daddy tell her that Santa is going to bring her presents on Christmas, she knows that he will.  Well, now Santa writes letters and my daughter is going to receive one. However, his special magic also allows him to be in Rovaniemi much of the time, all year round, for people to meet him. 
      Then when I say "Good-by and a merry Christmas to my little Susie Clemens," you must say "Good-bye, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much and please tell that little Snow Flake I will look at her star tonight and she must look down here" ... and every fine night I will look at her star and say, 'I know somebody up there and like her, too.'" It is poignant to read this letter. One of the first observances of Christmas in Mexico is the Feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe.

      When a child, anticipating the most magical time of the year, poetically writes her heartfelt letter to Santa Claus there is no doubt in her mind that her letter will be delivered. Rather than the focus on the Christmas tree with a manger scene placed in some adjacent location, the focus is on the crèche itself and those persons that make up the nativity ensemble.
