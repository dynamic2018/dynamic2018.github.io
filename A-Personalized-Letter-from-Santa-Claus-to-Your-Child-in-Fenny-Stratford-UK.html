      I enjoyed reading the early history of Saint Nicholas and how we are to know him as Santa Claus. 2/10 X   Kermit and his friends spend Christmas staging a surprise visit to Fozzie Bear's mother's farm. 
      Also the habit of entering houses through the chimney. Claus this season, telling the history of Santa letters from different angles: Letters to Santa , a selection of notes from 1930 to the present, selected from the thousands sent to the Santa Claus Museum in Santa Claus, Indiana (the city where Wilson Castile sent his letter); Dear Santa, which gathers earlier letters dated from 1870–1920; and The Santa Claus Man, my own book, which tells a true-crime tale of a Jazz Age huckster who abused a Santa letter–answering scheme to fill his own stockings with cash. 
      One year, Santa's large belt was backwards (perhaps because Sundblom was painting via a mirror). Once you have sent a letter to Santa, come back and check your mailbox by clicking “Santa Letter Pick-Up”.

"If you're going to have an ice-free Arctic and you're going to have big melts in the summertime but also limit ice recovery in the winter, you're going to have to have events like this happen." He continued, "If you have a lot of these events, especially with strong winds that can push that sea ice around and cause some vulnerabilities, if this is a pattern of things to come, it could really become worrisome for the stability of the Arctic." Incidentally, if you want to travel to the relative warmth of the North Pole, you may want to bring a lamp.All stories of Santa Claus and his cheery toy-making elves aside, the North Pole is a brutally cold, inhospitable place that has claimed the lives of countless explorers who attempted to venture there.
