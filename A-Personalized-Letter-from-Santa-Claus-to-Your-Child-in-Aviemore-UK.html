      In Scandinavia, a jolly elf named Jultomten was thought to deliver gifts in a sleigh drawn by goats. 4/10 X   A young man is sent to visit his estranged father for Christmas in 1930 in New Orleans. 
      Santa Became Animated in 2001 In 2001, the artwork from Sundblom's 1963 painting was the basis for an animated TV commercial starring the Coca-Cola Santa. All the same, Santa still receives far more letters than e-mail through the national postal operators, proving that children still write letters. 
      If children are in one home, or if there are several children from the same neighborhood, you will want each child to feel as though he's received a personalized letter. Northeast for that!  There's a 96% chance of snow every Christmas season.  And there's a 96% chance I'll be grumpy again tomorrow! 
      Santa needs your help to create a more personalized experience for your child this Christmas! During his lifetime, he adored children and often threw gifts anonymously into the windows of their homes. 
      In 2009, the Brazilian National Post Service, "Correios" answered almost two million children's letters, and spread some seasonal cheer by donating 414,000 Christmas gifts to some of Brazil's neediest citizens.[50] Through the years, the Finnish Santa Claus (Joulupukki or "Yule Goat") has received over eight million letters.

      I took to be "a trunk full of doll's clothes." Is that it? Robert Wise was also offered the chance to direct, but Wise had a different approach to the story. 
      For example, University of Texas psychology professor Jacqueline Woolley helped conduct a study that found, to the contrary, that children seemed competent in their use of logic, evidence, and comparative reasoning even though they might conclude that Santa Claus or other fanciful creatures were real: The adults they count on to provide reliable information about the world introduce them to Santa. Submitting to regular beard tuggings has become one of the latest tasks for Collins, who started working as a Santa at the North Pole gift shop and tourist attraction this past summer. 
      Did you know Santa did not save the Misfit Toys in the original 1964 stop motion animation “Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer?” According to the article ‘10 Things You Didn’t Know About Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer’ by Amanda Ferris, angry letters from children demanded the Misfit Toys be helped and thus the short scene that showed Santa and Rudolf making good on their promise to go back to the island and deliver the Misfits to homes was added and has been shown since 1965. The story wasn't that interesting to me but might engage a child or even another reader. 
      But familiar as the poem is, it still leaves much to the imagination, and the 19th century saw Santa appear in different-colored clothing, in sizes from miniature to massive, and in a variety of different guises. "I have a wonderful picture of him that looks exactly like George Washington riding a broomstick," Bowler said.
