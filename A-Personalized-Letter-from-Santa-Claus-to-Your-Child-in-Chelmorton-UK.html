      It is this organization that is behind the book Letters to Santa Claus, drawing on its archives of missives going back to the 1930s. “It goes from very simple letters to far more expensive wish lists—you watch the progression from ‘I’d like some blocks’ to ‘I’d like a VCR’ and ‘I’d like an iPad,’” says Emily Weisner Thompson, the executive director of the museum who compiled Letters to Santa. This is usually the third paragraph, but is sometimes the second or fourth. 
      This has usually been a very busy day with me, preparing for Christmas not only for my own tables, but for gifts for my servants. This is a good idea, as long as I get to give it the subtitle! 
      New Year's Eve, the Fourth of July and, especially, Thanksgiving had their merits and partisans, but Christmas emerged as the most logical and affecting choice. The volunteer program enlists people, businesses and charities to answer kids' letters addressed for Santa Claus and other winter characters, according to a news release. “What better way to celebrate the season than to help Santa and his elves read the thousands and thousands of letters we have on hand?” New York district manager William Schnaars said. Operation Santa in New York City alone responds to more than 500,000 letters a year. 
      This site offers two different letters for you to personalize and two background designs to choose from. If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons.

      The beautiful melody and lyrics has made this one of the most popular of carols in Sweden, and led to it being translated into many other languages including, of course, English. Fontana hopes to see the program evolve further, scanning the letters and uploading them where people can fulfill children’s wishes from their laptop or smartphone. 
      Think of the possibilities: Christmas New Years Valentine's Day St Patrick's Day April Fools Easter 4th of July Halloween Thanksgiving Next, decide where you will find your target market.
