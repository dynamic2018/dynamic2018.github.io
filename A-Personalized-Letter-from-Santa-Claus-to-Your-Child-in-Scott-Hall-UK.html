But at the end of the day all that matters is the good old Christmas spirit of love, generosity and kindness.  The spirit of giving without thinking about getting.The tensions in the Arctic were highlighted earlier this month when Canada staked a claim over the North Pole with the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.
