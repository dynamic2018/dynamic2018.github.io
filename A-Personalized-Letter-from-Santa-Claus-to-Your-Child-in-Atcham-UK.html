      From: Send a letter To Santa Claus at The North Pole - Santa's ... Nicholas", who comes down the chimney on the 5th/6th of December) and the imagery of the Saint in question carried over to his North Pole incarnation. (Note that in several countries in Europe, Sinterklaas and Santa Claus are considered two entirely different characters, each with their own elaborate holiday.) The modern figure of Santa Claus is typically depicted as a fat-bellied happy old man with a long white beard dressed in a red coat with white collar and cuffs, white-cuffed red trousers, and black leather belt and boots, who carries a bag full of toys and gifts for children. [1] He lives at the North Pole in a large workshop staffed by elves which produces toys year round, and every Christmas Eve he sets out in a flying sleigh pulled by at least eight reindeer, delivering toys and other gifts to the children and children-at-heart of the world out of the improbably large sack he carries with him, entering their houses by the chimney, filling their stockings, putting larger gifts under the tree, partaking of whatever food and drink the family left out for him (traditionally cookies and milk), then leaving how he came in. 
      From then on, the festive joy of the words and the rich melodic tone allowed the carol to grow hugely in popularity and at least two English sources from late Victorian times described it as the nation's favourite carol. Anyway, if you do not believe in magic, then there will not be any sense.
