      The modern Christmas tree was developed in early modern Germany (where it is today called Weihnachtsbaum or Christbaum), The tree was traditionally decorated with "roses made of colored paper, apples, wafers, tinsel, [and] sweetmeats".[1] In the 18th century, it began to be illuminated by candles which were ultimately replaced by Christmas lights after the advent of electrification.While we try to avoid advertisers of fraudulent products, What Really Happened assumes no liability for such fraud.

In the 1850s, Fanny Longfellow (wife of the poet Henry Wadsworth) wrote her three children letters each Christmas that commented on their behavior over the previous year and how they could improve it. “[Y]ou have picked up some naughty words which I hope you will throw away as you would sour or bitter fruit,” Santa explained in an 1853 letter. “Try to stop to think before you use any, and remember if no one else hears you God is always near.” In an era before childhood was celebrated as a distinct period of a person’s life, gratifying kids’ imaginations was less important than teaching them manners that would speed them toward adulthood. 
      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!Itʼs possible that these automated requests were sent from another user on your network. Having an online set up for your Santa Clause letters business will increase your profits and make it easier for customers to pay and to make repeat sales.
