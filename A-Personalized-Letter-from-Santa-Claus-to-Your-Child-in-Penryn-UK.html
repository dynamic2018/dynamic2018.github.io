      The German LDS hymnbook, she says, has four Christmas hymns the English doesn't. Taped inside each hat was a note reading, "You’re Going To Disney World!" Tears of joy ensued. 
      Add the return address: “SANTA, NORTH POLE” to the envelope. Thus, we can write a letter to Santa Claus for free, well, of course, except for a small postage on the envelope, and postage stamps.

      A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates. Though the exact origin of a Christmas wreath is not recorded, it is said that they originated before Christianity itself.
