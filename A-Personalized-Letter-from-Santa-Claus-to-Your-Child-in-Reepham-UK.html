      A great book to read aro ARC copy supplied through Net Galley This was a lovely history of the legendas of St Nicholas and how traditions started across the world and how he came to be known as Santa Claus or Father Christmas. The Dresden Files has Harry saying that Santa is a fairy. note  Butcher has hinted that he is basically the Fairy King of Winter and a counterpoart of sorts to Mab. 
      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!When I was growing up, Santa Claus visited our home every Christmas. Around 2800 BC, Achernar was only 8 degrees from the south pole. 
      Father Christmas is the traditional English name for personification of Christmas. If you don't want to extend it too long, use our Surprise!
