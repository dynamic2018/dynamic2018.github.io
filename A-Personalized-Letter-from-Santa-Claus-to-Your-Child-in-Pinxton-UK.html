      I will go to the moon and get those things and in a few minutes I will come down the chimney that belongs to the fireplace that is in the hall--if it is a trunk you want--because I couldn't get such a thing as a trunk down the nursery chimney, you know . . . .

      When asked why there has been so many letters being sent this year, elf Silvia Seger suggested that is was because “the children can write a letter on the internet, we get media [attention] every year and we've been on the travel channel and some others.” Seger is an elf of 10 years. “Keeping a child’s ideas of Santa alive by sending a letter and getting a letter from Santa has to be special,” said Seger. With the commencement of the Twentieth century, Christmas began to grow more and more popular among most Europeans and Americans and began to be celebrated with gusto.
