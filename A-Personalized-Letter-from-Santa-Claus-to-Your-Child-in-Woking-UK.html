      A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates.

How and exactly when the words of 'Veni veni Emmanuel' became united with the funeral hymn is unknown, but certainly it had happened by 1851, when John Mason Neale translated the words from Latin into English (Neale was a prolific translator of hymns and carols from many other languages into English, as well as composing some carols of his own, including 'Good King Wenceslas'.) When Neale wrote the English language version of the carol, he titled it 'Draw nigh, draw nigh, Emmanuel', but later modifications of the text gave us the title and verses we know today. 
      Anyway, Santa Claus lives at the North Pole and that's that and I'm not moving!  Besides, I like my Canadian postal code: H0H 0H0.  (HO HO HO!) Ok, ok, Santa Claus does have other places around the world.  I'll tell you about them too.  (Why do I suddenly feel a bit like his travel agent?)  He does visit them every year (kind of like having summer homes -- does he think he's Brad Pitt or something?)  But I like staying at the North Pole.  I'm nice and grumpy right here, thank you!Drøbak,Norway Many years ago, Santa Claus built a Christmas House (Julehuset) right next to the town square in Drøbak.

      Canada Everyone knows Santa Claus lives at the North Pole!  But where exactly in Canada is it?  After all, there is more than one North Pole in Canada!  (Ssh!  I didn't tell you that!)  Well, that's another one of Santa's secrets. 
      You will find that I made no mistakes about the things which you and the baby ordered in your own letters--I went down your chimney at midnight when you were asleep and delivered them all myself--and kissed both of you, too, because you are good children, well trained, nice mannered, and about the most obedient little people I ever saw.And of course, every Santa letter is stamped with our trademark "Santa's Official Mail" seal and a genuine North Pole postmark.
