      The Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony did not observe Christmas, with Governor John Winthrop even attempting to suppress it.[4] One author writes, "The Puritans showed their disdain for this pagan festival by planning hard work for the day and passing a law forbidding the celebration of Christmas."[5] By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, however, Christmas celebrations had become very popular and reflected the expanding commerce that America became known for following the Industrial Revolution. Elf by elf, toy by toy, Santa Claus' Christmas toy factory is bustling with activity! 
      He greets the kids and gives the grown-ups a hearty Finnish handshake. Nick of time, it's going to be a very glacial "Frostmas" all around the world! 
      Letter from santa claus when u write santa! see free video.Santa Claus Indiana mail SANTA'S ELVES: Residents of Santa Claus, Indiana help send responses from Santa to children all over the world. (The Epoch Times) Santa Claus and his elves are alive and well, but not at the North Pole where you might expect. On Christmas Eve, the trees were decorated with tiny candles which was a great fire hazard. 
      Avoid the flop: If you’re doing a scavenger hunt, arrange the hunt so your child finds the more obvious clues after the tougher ones. He also discovers that the new timeline has affected other people as well. 
      Most of the letters are done in shades of red and green, adding to the holiday cheer.   Typically, they include check boxes that kids can mark stating whether they have been naughty or nice.
