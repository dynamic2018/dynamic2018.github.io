      Little clay figures, traditionally made in the south of France, are called “santons” (“little saints”). All throughout, I was truly amazed by the fabulous complexity of the drawings created by Marie Hall Ets, and by the sensitive story that evokes a memorable sense of the magic surrounding Christmas. 
      From 1931 to 1964, Coca-Cola advertising showed Santa delivering toys (and playing with them!), pausing to read a letter and enjoy a Coke, visiting with the children who stayed up to greet him, and raiding the refrigerators at a number of homes. But as I read and really looked at the pictures, I noticed and enjoyed the delicate detail of the pictures, yet with the simple feel that supports the story nicely.

      The picture above is from Josiah King’s The Examination and Tryal of Father Christmas (1686), published shortly after Christmas was reinstated as a holy day in England after being banned in post Civil War England as a symbol of “Catholic superstition and godless self-indulgence.” 1810 Although the east coast of America was full of Dutch settlers, it was not until the early 19th century that the figure of “Sinterklaas” would make his way properly across the Atlantic and so give birth to the Americanised Santa Claus. By then, he had come to think of the pole as his birthright.

      One presumes that there's at least one good child in each. Your mama can show you that star and you will say: 'Little Snow Flake,' (for that is the child's name) 'I'm glad you got that furniture, for you need it more than I.'" But Santa Clemens says he couldn't make out some words in an adult's hand: "I took it to be "a trunk full of doll's clothes." Is that it? 
      A Christmas Carol, written by Charles Dickens, was a story which brought to the forefront love for all men and helping the poor. 
      In the 1850s, Fanny Longfellow (wife of the poet Henry Wadsworth) wrote her three children letters each Christmas that commented on their behavior over the previous year and how they could improve it. “[Y]ou have picked up some naughty words which I hope you will throw away as you would sour or bitter fruit,” Santa explained in an 1853 letter. “Try to stop to think before you use any, and remember if no one else hears you God is always near.” In an era before childhood was celebrated as a distinct period of a person’s life, gratifying kids’ imaginations was less important than teaching them manners that would speed them toward adulthood.If the baby does not know how to write, take the drawing of the letter itself, actively connecting it to the process.

      He is surrounded by hunters instead of shepherds, and the wise men or kings are chiefs who bring him 'fox and beaver pelts' instead of gold, frankincense and myrrh. Then when I say “Good bye and a merry Christmas to my little Susie Clemens,” you must say “Good bye, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much and please tell that little Snow Flake I will look at her star tonight and she must look down here—I will be right in the west bay window; and every fine night I will look at her star and say, ‘I know somebody up there and likeher, too.'” Then you must go down into the library and make George close all the doors that open into the main hall, and everybody must keep still for a little while.
