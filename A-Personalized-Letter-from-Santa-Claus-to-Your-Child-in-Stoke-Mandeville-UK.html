His motto: “Restoring America’s heart and soul.” “I haven’t heard either of the big boys talk about anything with respect to children, so I’d like to use that as a platform to insinuate my views on children, their health, safety and welfare and that’s what I meant by restoring America’s heart and soul,” Claus told the Guardian in 2012. “We have presidents and candidates and all these other politicians that are really into the whole war machine, some other things that aren’t particularly good for children in my view and I would like to see voters consider changing that.” Claus got 625 votes in 2012 (Maryland seems to be the only state that counted him) though it’s not clear that everyone who voted for him knew they were casting their ballot for a real person. 
      Before the vote, he wrote on Facebook:  I am an Alaska state-registered medical cannabis patient (Cannabidiol) and have successfully been taking the oil to treat my cancer diagnosed 4 years ago.
