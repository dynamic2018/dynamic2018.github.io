      Sending And Receiving A Christmas Letter From Santa At The North Pole Letters to Santa serve many purposes; they allow parents to gain an idea of what presents children want and encourage a continued belief in Santa and the spirit of Christmas. The custom did eventually gain wider acceptance beginning around 1815 by way of Prussian officials who emigrated there following the Congress of Vienna.

      I just hope he doesn't outsource all the work to the Chinese elves!  They did make an amazing ice sculpture though.  I'm just grumpy I'm not good at ice sculptures.  Guess I'll just stick to making Snow Grumpies (that's what I call snow angels).
