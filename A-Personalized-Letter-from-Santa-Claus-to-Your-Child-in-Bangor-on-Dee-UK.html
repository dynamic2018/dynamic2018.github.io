      Net Galley Feedback May 20, 2015 Ellen Klock rated it really liked it As the holidays draw near, the public or school library can't have enough Christmas stories on the shelf. It was really hard for Ceci to plan for her first posada and choose her first piñata as she couldn’t contain her eagerness. 
      Santa "knows" your childs name, their brothers and sisters names, he knows what the child left out for his snack last year, he knows what your child wants for christmas and does not make promises he cant keep! For example, my friend Anya, asking to meet a good guy, promised that she would quit smoking. 
      Even accounting for the snow wizard e-mail should not ignore those recommendations that we gave you above. I'm a jolly bowl a jelly, giving holiday presents. 
      And hey, the Flying Spaghetti Monster judged him already. edit Belief and Disbelief Many have often had tried to counterexample the fact that Santa can't exist. Please be sure to hang your stocking and be in bed early as Christmas is such a busy day! 
      Include a deadline date of December 1 in your advertisement, and let parents know the last letters will be mailed by December 8.

      The Christmas wreaths were said to have been constructed of evergreen branches, symbolizing the life of the earth that never truly dies (despite the blistery winter winds and chills). A 2004 study found that while in general artificial trees pose little health risk from lead contamination, there do exist "worst-case scenarios" where major health risks to young children exist.[111] A 2008 United States Environmental Protection Agency report found that as the PVC in artificial Christmas trees aged it began to degrade.[112] The report determined that of the 50 million artificial trees in the United States approximately 20 million were 9 or more years old, the point where dangerous lead contamination levels are reached.[112] A professional study on the life-cycle assessment of both real and artificial Christmas trees revealed that one must use an artificial Christmas tree at least 20 years to leave an environmental footprint as small as the natural Christmas tree.[109] Religious issues[edit] A 1931 edition of the Soviet magazine Bezbozhnik, distributed by the League of Militant Atheists, depicting an Orthodox Christian priest being forbidden to cut down a tree for Christmas The Christmas tree was first used by German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strassburg in 1539, under the leadership of the Protestant Reformer, Martin Bucer.[113][114] In the United States, these "German Lutherans brought the decorated Christmas tree with them; the Moravians put lighted candles on those trees."[115][116] When decorating the Christmas tree, many individuals place a star at the top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem, a fact recorded by The School Journal in 1897.[2][117] Professor David Albert Jones of Oxford University writes that in the 19th century, it became popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of Jesus.[3] Under the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union, after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations—along with other religious holidays—were prohibited as a result of the Soviet anti-religious campaign.[118][119][120] The League of Militant Atheists encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, among them being the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays, including Easter; the League established an anti-religious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement.[121] With the Christmas tree being prohibited in accordance with Soviet anti-religious legislation, people supplanted the former Christmas custom with New Year's trees.[120][122] In 1935 the tree was brought back as New Year tree and became a secular, not a religious holiday.
