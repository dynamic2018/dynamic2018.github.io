      Christmas Musical Train & Track Set Toys Kids Party Birthday Gift Decoration New £9. This visible star has gone by so many names in its past - The Steering Star, the Lodestar, Stella Mars (aka Star of the Sea), the Ship Star, and Tou Mu in China (a Chinese majesty of the Polaris).

      A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates. I just hope he doesn't outsource all the work to the Chinese elves!  They did make an amazing ice sculpture though.  I'm just grumpy I'm not good at ice sculptures.  Guess I'll just stick to making Snow Grumpies (that's what I call snow angels).
