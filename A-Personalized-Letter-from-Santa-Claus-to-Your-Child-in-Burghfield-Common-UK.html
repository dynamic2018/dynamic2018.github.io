      What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus? Aleisha Hindmarsh · October 2, 2017 Really cool place to visit. 
      When a child, anticipating the most magical time of the year, poetically writes her heartfelt letter to Santa Claus there is no doubt in her mind that her letter will be delivered. Nothing illustrates this better than National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, when Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) turns his house in a mess of extension cords in his insane quest for the perfect 250-strand display. 
      Viewers of the 1964 special complained that Santa was not shown fulfilling his promise to the Misfit Toys (to include them in his annual toy delivery). When the kitchen doorbell rings, George must be blindfolded and sent to the door. 
      An example of a public and private cooperative venture is the opportunity for expatriate and local children and parents to receive postmarked mail and greeting cards from Santa during December in the Finnish Embassy in Beijing, People's Republic of China,[80] Santa Claus Village in Rovaniemi, Finland, and the People's Republic of China Postal System's Beijing International Post Office.[81][82][83][84] Parents can order a personalized "Santa letter" to be sent to their child, often with a North Pole postmark. You can think about the historical people we have been talking about, Andrew Jackson, Martin van Buren and others, and the ways they too might have celebrated Christmas.

      Sending the Letters to Santa Claus' Address Now that your child has written their letter to Santa, wouldn't it be fun for them to get a reply?The joyful anticipation of unknown treasures when morning finally arrived. 
      The eighteenth century did, however, offer relief from this Puritan Grinchness in the form of hymns written by Watts, the so-called Liberator of the English Hymn, and the flood of hymn writers who followed his lead in what has been referred to as the Golden Age of Hymns. The tadpoles started receiving letters with clues. They were so excited to have something addressed to them that it never dawned on them that these letters might mean something. 
      And of course, every Santa letter is stamped with our trademark "Santa's Official Mail" seal and a genuine North Pole postmark. The jolly, chubby, grandfatherly face of this Santa was largely created by Thomas Nast, the great political cartoonist in an era that featured many. "However, Nast did leave him half-sized," Bowler added, "and in what I think are rather indecent long johns." Once firmly established, North America's Santa then underwent a kind of reverse migration to Europe, replacing the scary gift bringers and adopting local names like Père Noël (France) or Father Christmas (Great Britain). "What he's done is pretty much tame these Grimm's Fairy Tales-type characters from the late medieval days," Bowler said. (Related: "Real Christmas Trees Save Water.")
