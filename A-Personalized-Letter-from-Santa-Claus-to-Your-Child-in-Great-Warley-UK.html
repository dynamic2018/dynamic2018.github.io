      They began dressing up unemployed men in Santa Claus suits and sending them into the streets of New York to solicit donations.

      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!Quotations | Newspaper Articles | Special Features | Links | Search SPECIAL FEATURE Mark Twain's Letter from Santa Claus Palace of St. The rest comes wrapped in different paper from Mom and Dad, or their sibling, or Grandparents (my mom comes to visit in November for the kids' birthdays and does her Christmas shopping for them while she is here and leaves their presents with me to put under the tree -saves on shipping costs since they live 8 hours away).

      Honestly, I thought I was getting a book that was much more classic of ‘our’ Santa Claus, and aimed more towards family, especially our children, but I was very wrong. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      Scott goes after the Toy Santa, who has already left with the sleigh, riding Chet, a reindeer-in-training, and they both crash back into the village. What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus?
