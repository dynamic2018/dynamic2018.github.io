      All of us in my North Pole workshop have been hard at work getting ready for Christmas. Because there really are reindeer in Finland, and we are living up North, the popular American cult took root in Finland very fast. 
      The practice dates back to the 14th century, when apples were hung on evergreen trees to serve as props for the miracle plays presented in churches on December 24. "For many early Americans, hanging citrus on a Christmas tree would have been an extra-special treat," says Karch. Previous letters can be used by children as a basis for writing their most recent letter to Santa and even used as a start point for writing a Christmas morning letter to Santa to thank him for all the wonderful new toys they received. 
      The process was probably a continuous amalgamation of many old folk customs and beliefs from varied sources.
