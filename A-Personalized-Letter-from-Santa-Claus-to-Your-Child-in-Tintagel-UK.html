      Anyway, Santa Claus lives at the North Pole and that's that and I'm not moving!  Besides, I like my Canadian postal code: H0H 0H0.  (HO HO HO!) Ok, ok, Santa Claus does have other places around the world.  I'll tell you about them too.  (Why do I suddenly feel a bit like his travel agent?)  He does visit them every year (kind of like having summer homes -- does he think he's Brad Pitt or something?)  But I like staying at the North Pole.  I'm nice and grumpy right here, thank you! His trip seems to take 24 hours to us, but to Santa it might last days, weeks or even months.

      Then when I say "Good-by and a merry Christmas to my little Susy Clemens," you must say "Good-by, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much." Then you must go down into the library and make George close all the doors that open into the main hall, and everybody must keep still for a little while.

      He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread; He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, And laying his finger aside of his nose, And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. For many years, those who could afford to would express their Christmas spirit by lighting candles on trees. “Generally, the tree was set up in the parlor and when all the family would come down to see the tree, dad or grandpa would light up all the candles,” John Hanssen, an collector of Christmas-related antiques, tells TIME. “You’d look at it for a few seconds and blow them out.” Candles were lit to “signify the light of Jesus,” according to Hanssen, 46, who is a member of the Golden Glow of Christmas Past, an international organization for Christmas history. 
      Your mama can show you that star and you will say: "Little Snow Flake," (for that is the child's name) "I'm glad you got that furniture, for you need it more than I." That is, you must write that, with your own hand, and Snow Flake will write you an answer. According to Christmas custom, two people who meet under the mistletoe must kiss.
