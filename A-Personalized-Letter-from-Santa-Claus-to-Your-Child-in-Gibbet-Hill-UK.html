      Whatever the truth, the song took off, first in Austria where a singing family called the Strassers performed 'Stille Nacht' at a Leipzig concert in 1832, and then in America, where the Rainer family performed the carol outside Trinity Church in New York City in 1839. Smiles are plentiful, but outright laughs are widely scattered.

A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates.
