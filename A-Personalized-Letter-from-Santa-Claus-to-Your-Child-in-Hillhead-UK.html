This is why parents go for the attractions loved by the modern day children instead of keeping oranges. 
      Before the Russian Revolution, Grandfather Frost (Ded Moroz) was a favored figure of Christmas who had adopted characteristics of proto-Santas like the Dutch Sinterklaas. "When the Soviet Union was formed, the communists abolished the celebration of Christmas and gift bringers," Bowler said. "Then in the 1930s, when Stalin needed to build support, he allowed the reemergence of Grandfather Frost not as a Christmas gift bringer but as a New Year's gift bringer," Bowler added. It's never too late to start a family tradition, and the Original Letter from Santa is offered in more than two dozen styles to suit multiple occasions and circumstances, including letters specifically designed for baby's first Christmas, toddlers, adults, and non-believers, as well as for children facing tumultuous times in their lives.

He is also called Kris Kringle - which comes from the German term “the Christ Child” ^ Back to Top Clement C.

      According to the Associated Press, the 2013 Sinterklass festival in Amsterdam drew protestors saying Black Pete was a blatant racist caricature that should be banned. Let him or her put it into an envelope addressed simply “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE.”  Later, secretly open the letter and write a response from Santa. USPS suggests writing it on the back of your child’s letter so he or she can see the original along with Santa’s response. “When responding as Santa, make the response as personal as possible by highlighting your child’s accomplishments over the past year,” USPS suggests. “For example, helping around the house, receiving good grades in a particular subject at school or participating in community service activities.” Then, put it in an envelope addressed to your child with “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE” as the return address.  Add the proper postage ― USPS suggests one of its new holiday-themed stamps ― then put it inside a larger envelope, also with the necessary postage. 
      This year, there will probably be no presents from Santa, but she's 4 months old. Like some cool refreshing water Or a gentle summer breeze, Like a fresh bouquet of flowers Or the smell of autumn leaves, It's a banquet for the spirit Filled with family, food and friends, So allow yourself some happiness It's Christmas time again! 
      With all of his reindeer to care for, Santa is certainly an animal lover, and he hasn't forgotten the family pet: special versions of the Original Letter from Santa are even available for that special pampered family dog or cat.
