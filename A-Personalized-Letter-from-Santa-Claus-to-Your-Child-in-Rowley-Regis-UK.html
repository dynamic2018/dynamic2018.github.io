      If you come across any problems or wish to ask a question, please do not hesitate to contact our Support service using the contact us form.Our Santa Letters have been a holiday tradition for generations. It can be a fun and profitable way to earn real income. 
      Ordering Information What types of payment do you accept online? Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      Each letter also includes a jumbo sticker, proclaiming the bearer to be "on Santa's Good List; an exclusive, keepsake "Santa Dollar;" and a full-color keepsake photo of Santa. Santa answers every letter that is sent to him, but he has so much mail it usually takes him about three days to write back to you. 
      History[edit] The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of cracker bonbons and the pulling of crackers from the early 1840s.[4] Tradition tells of how Tom Smith of London invented crackers in 1847.[5][6] He created the crackers as a development of his bon-bon sweets, which he sold in a twist of paper (the origins of the traditional sweet-wrapper). When Nicholas' relics were taken by sailors and moved to Bari, Italy in 1087, following the Muslim invasion of Myra, a church was built upon them, inaugurated by Pope Urban II.[3] Six hundred years after Myra's end, the Russian Emperor Vladimir visited Constantinople and heard all the wonderful stories about Bishop Nicholas and decided to make him the patron saint of Russia. 
      By holding Christmas at the same time as traditional winter solstice festivals, church leaders increased the chances that Christmas would be popularly embraced, but gave up the ability to dictate how it was celebrated.
