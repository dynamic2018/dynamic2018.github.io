      Santa's Official North Pole Mail - Here you can create a beautiful custom letter for your child. A button just popped off my nice new red suit                @KringleClaus: After I eat this cookie, I'll go run around the North Pole.

A real estate representative selling him property in Oklahoma first gave him a suit about three years ago and Collins was talked into playing Santa for a visit to a preschool and a high school football game.

      What's important to monitor is whether the warming becomes part of a pattern that reduces sea ice in the Arctic, something scientists are watching closely. "Some climate models predict an ice-free Arctic at least part of the year in the coming decades," Miller said. "If you're going to have an ice-free Arctic and you're going to have big melts in the summertime but also limit ice recovery in the winter, you're going to have to have events like this happen." He continued, "If you have a lot of these events, especially with strong winds that can push that sea ice around and cause some vulnerabilities, if this is a pattern of things to come, it could really become worrisome for the stability of the Arctic." Incidentally, if you want to travel to the relative warmth of the North Pole, you may want to bring a lamp.All stories of Santa Claus and his cheery toy-making elves aside, the North Pole is a brutally cold, inhospitable place that has claimed the lives of countless explorers who attempted to venture there.
