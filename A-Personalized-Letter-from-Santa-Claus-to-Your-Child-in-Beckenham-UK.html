      The "No Christmas" policy was reiterated by Parliament in 1652 with the following resolution: "That no observation shall be had of the five and twentieth day of December commonly called Christmas-Day; nor any solemnity used or exercised in churches upon the day in respect thereof." Though this policy was not enforced in Virginia, it is easy to speculate that this is at least one of the reasons that seventeenth- and eighteenth-century colonists were fairly close-mouthed about the celebration of Christmas. Then you must go up to the nursery and stand on a chair or the nurse's bed and put your ear to the speaking tube that leads down to the kitchen and when I whistle through it you must speak in the tube and say, "Welcome, Santa Claus!" Then I will ask whether it was a trunk you ordered or not. 
      For the maximum exposure to your letters from Santa Clause business, you will want to consider marketing both online and offline. Think of a fairy tale about a goldfish and how badly the greedy old woman finished. 
      To do this requires very little : paper, pen, colored pencils, imagination and a great desire to write really beautiful, touching letter.
