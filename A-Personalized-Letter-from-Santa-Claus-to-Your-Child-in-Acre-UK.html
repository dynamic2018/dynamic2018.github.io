Maturing about 110 days after planting, this melon can grow to 12 inches (30 cm) in length and half that in diameter. 
      Or everyone could send him a spare house key, but there's no way he could put millions of keys on his key chain. Prices range from $55 for their annual Commitment ornament to $175 for a set of three miniature trees.
