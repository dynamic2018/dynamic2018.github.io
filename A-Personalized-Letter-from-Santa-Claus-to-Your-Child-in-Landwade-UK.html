      July 26, 2002 | Rating: 2/5 Bob Grimm Las Vegas Mercury View All Critic Reviews (18) Audience Reviews for Santa Claus: The Movie Wahida K Super Reviewer ½ Candy Rose Super Reviewer ½ Lafe Fredbjornson Super Reviewer ½ Jason Spencer Super Reviewer View All Audience Reviews Santa Claus: The Movie Quotes There are no approved quotes yet for this movie.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Santa Claus: The Movie (known on-screen as simply Santa Claus) is a 1985 Christmas film starring Dudley Moore and John Lithgow. His reasons include weak plot, garish production design, blatant product placement (particularly for McDonald's, though Coke and Pabst Blue Ribbon are also prominent), and scenery-chewing overacting on the part of Lithgow. 
      Sinterklaas' assistants are called "Zwarte Pieten" (in Dutch, "Pères Fouettard" in French), so they are not elves.[19] Germanic paganism, Wodan, and Christianization An 1886 depiction of the long-bearded Norse god Odin by Georg von Rosen Prior to Christianization, the Germanic peoples (including the English) celebrated a midwinter event called Yule (Old English geola or giuli).[20] With the Christianization of Germanic Europe, numerous traditions were absorbed from Yuletide celebrations into modern Christmas.[21] During this period, supernatural and ghostly occurrences were said to increase in frequency, such as the Wild Hunt, a ghostly procession through the sky.[citation needed] The leader of the wild hunt is frequently attested as the god Wodan (Norse Odin), bearing (among many names) the names Jólnir, meaning "Yule figure", and Langbarðr, meaning "long-beard", in Old Norse.[22] Wodan's role during the Yuletide period has been theorized as having influenced concepts of St.

      The 1951 version by Perry Como was the first measurable hit; Gene Autry, the country-western artist, recorded a Christmas album with this title and featuring the song in 1953; and in 1963 the Four Seasons version charted at number 23 on Billboard.[5] In 1970 Rankin-Bass produced Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town, an hour-long animated TV film based on the song, with Fred Astaire narrating the origin of Santa Claus.

      A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates.

      The modern Christmas tree was developed in early modern Germany (where it is today called Weihnachtsbaum or Christbaum), The tree was traditionally decorated with "roses made of colored paper, apples, wafers, tinsel, [and] sweetmeats".[1] In the 18th century, it began to be illuminated by candles which were ultimately replaced by Christmas lights after the advent of electrification.

You can read it in its entirety below, but first a little bit of pretext. In the Western Christian tradition, Christmas trees are variously erected on days such as the first day of Advent or even as late as Christmas Eve depending on the country;[4] customs of the same faith hold that the two traditional days when Christmas decorations, such as the Christmas tree, are removed are Twelfth Night and if they are not taken down on that day, Candlemas, the latter of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some denominations.[4][5] The Christmas tree is sometimes compared with the "Yule-tree", especially in discussions of its folkloric origins.[6][7][8] Contents History[edit] Possible predecessors[edit] From Northern Antiquities, an English translation of the Prose Edda from 1847.
