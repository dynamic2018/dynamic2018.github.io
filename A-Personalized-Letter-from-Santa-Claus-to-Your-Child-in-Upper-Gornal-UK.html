      Although Santa Claus and Father Christmas have picked up many attributes from each other, and are now basically considered the same person, they were originally distinct characters. 
      How It Works Father Christmas asks children to write out their Christmas lists and place them in an envelope with the address below clearly written on the front.In later Nast drawings a home at the North Pole was added, as was the workshop for building toys and a large book filled with the names of children who had been naughty or nice. 
      They would make a great addition to your christmas decorations. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      Santa will use his magical powers to instantly send you a free letter from santa directly in your web browser and Santa will also tell you if you are on the nice or naughty list (and we hope you are on the nice list!).Originally named Santa Fe, the town had to change its name in 1856 when it applied for a post office only to discover that there was already another town with that name in the state. In the case of Mexican Christmas, this preparation takes place during the nine days preceding Christmas’ Eve, or “Noche Buena” (December 24th).
