      Nicholas gave only to those who were needy and that today Santa Claus seems to be more about conspicuous consumption: Our jolly old Saint Nicholas reflects our culture to a T, for he is fanciful, exuberant, bountiful, over-weight, and highly commercial. NC (voiceover): So just when it looks like the Christmas equivalent of “When the Wind Blows,” suddenly a bright light appears, bathing them in a heavenly glow. (Beat) Clearly, they are dead. (A group of elves approach the sleigh while holding candles) NC (voiceover): So little elves come out through the light—though I use the term a little loosely, as one minute, they’re the size of G. 
      Joe and Cornelia eavesdrop on the conversation, but Joe is caught and locked up in the basement of B. Over time, these traditions have expanded to include people renowned for their generosity, such as Saint Nicholas, and have given rise to legends such as Santa Claus. 
      Let him or her put it into an envelope addressed simply “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE.”  Later, secretly open the letter and write a response from Santa. USPS suggests writing it on the back of your child’s letter so he or she can see the original along with Santa’s response. “When responding as Santa, make the response as personal as possible by highlighting your child’s accomplishments over the past year,” USPS suggests. “For example, helping around the house, receiving good grades in a particular subject at school or participating in community service activities.” Then, put it in an envelope addressed to your child with “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE” as the return address.  Add the proper postage ― USPS suggests one of its new holiday-themed stamps ― then put it inside a larger envelope, also with the necessary postage. SURE!   We   understand   how   important   a   baby's   first   Christmas   can   be!   That's   why   we   offer   two   different   special   letters written   just   for   newborns.   Just   place   your   order   as   normal   using   our   simple   Santa   Letter   Designer   and   select   the   'Baby’s First'    or    'Very   First   Xmas'   text   template   when   you   get   to   that   step   of   the   design   process.      (Tip:   The   background   you   choose for   your   letter   from   Santa.      But   when   you   get   to   the   'Choose   the   text   template   for   your   letter'   s ection   is   where   you   want to select the right text.) I have more than one child, will they receive the exact same letter from Santa? 
      Tip: All of the Santa clip art below is free for you to use for personal projects but you'll need to check each image's terms if you want to use the picture commercially.
