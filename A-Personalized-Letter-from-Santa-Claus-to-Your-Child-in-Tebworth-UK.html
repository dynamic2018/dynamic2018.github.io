      Many of those items today are popular collectibles. Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time!

I took it to be "a trunk full of doll's clothes." Is that it? 
      He was even nicer than I thought, even sat on his knee and told him how good I'd been! Silvered saran-based tinsel was introduced later.
