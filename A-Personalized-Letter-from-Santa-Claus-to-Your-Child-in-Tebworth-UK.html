      As everyone knows, Santa Claus makes his home farther north in Finland, on a mountain called Korvatunturi. On 23 December 2008, Jason Kenney, Canada's minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, formally awarded Canadian citizenship status to Santa Claus. "The Government of Canada wishes Santa the very best in his Christmas Eve duties and wants to let him know that, as a Canadian citizen, he has the automatic right to re-enter Canada once his trip around the world is complete," Kenney said in an official statement.[5] There is also a city named North Pole in Alaska where a tourist attraction known as the "Santa Claus House" has been established.
