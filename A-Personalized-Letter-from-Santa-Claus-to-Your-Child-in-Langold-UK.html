      What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus? Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      While the postal employees shuttle the gifts to children, it is the donors who pay for them. “It’s amazing how it can vary from almost nothing to the extreme,” says Fontana. We were here twice - April 26 2017 and Sept 7 2017. 
      The police asked them so questions."So who did the crime". Odin was also a gift-giver like Nicholas, sharing his wisdom with mortals via the runes. 
      Scott Calvin (Tim Allen), who doubles as Santa Claus, has settled into his home at the North Pole with his new wife, Carol (Elizabeth Mitchell), and is preparing for another Christmas when he receives a visitor -- Jack Frost (Martin Short), the cold-weather sprite who has been sent to help out St. But I must not see anybody and I must not speak to anybody but you.

      Oh, and Deadpool once choked him out with a string of barbed wire while he (Santa) was driving an eighteen-wheeler. For Santa to do his work, he must secretly slip in and out of a home. 
      Artist Louis Prang depicted him that way in a series of Christmas cards in 1885, and The New York Times reported on the red garments in 1927. Since , children have had the joy of receiving letters from Santa Claus for free and tradition continues today. 
      Madman Doctor Otto Octavius once took over Santa's workshop, imprisoned Claus, and forced his elves to create deadly toys that would be sent out to injure children.They tell him if they have been naughty or nice and what they want for Christmas. 
      In Costa Rica, Colombia, and parts of Mexico, the gift bearer is el Niño Jesus, “the infant Jesus.” In Brazil and Peru, he's called Papai Noel. At the end of the letter, put something like “p.s. – check around the kitchen for a special surprise from my elves” and then hide a smaller package somewhere in that room. 
      However, in the cover to the first edition of Baum’s book we see the red of his suit is still yet to be ‘mandatory’. 
      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!As everyone knows, this is Santa’s busiest time of year ― and it’s tough for the big guy to answer every Christmas letter himself.  So if your kids want a letter from Santa Claus (or maybe you want one yourself!), you may have to take matters into your own hands.  The United States Postal Service has some of Santa’s helpers standing by at its Anchorage post office, ready to return letters to kids complete with a “NORTH POLE” postmark.  Here’s how it works: Have your child write a letter to Santa.Among the original choices to direct the film other than Carpenter were Lewis Gilbert, who, despite initial interest, could not agree with the Salkinds over certain aspects of the script. 
      Do you know how hard it is to keep the magic of Christmas and the myth of Santa Claus alive for your children? Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time!

      The author[31] quotes Moore's poem in its entirety, saying that its descriptions apply to Krishkinkle too.[32] As the years passed, Santa Claus evolved in popular culture into a large, heavyset person.
