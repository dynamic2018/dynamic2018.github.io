      A photographer elf snaps away, immortalising the moment. In 1881, political cartoonist Thomas Nast drew on Moore’s poem to create the first likeness that matches our modern image of Santa Claus. 
      But in fact, in order to send a letter to Santa Claus, and know that it certainly gets to the destination, and perhaps even get an answer, just write the correct address. Why be sad, if there is a simple and easily accessible way to create yourself is not just fun, and even a New Year mood. 
      In just a matter of moments Santa is replying to the letter. You'll mail back a letter from Santa Claus that goes directly to the child.

      Then simply hit the send button and the letter is  sent off to Santa. Gifts symbolized and helped secure these important relationships. 
      Here's a look at what goes down at the jolliest place on the planet during the busiest season of the year. Now each ornament had a touch of individual craftsmanship and became highly prized possessions. 
      What's important to monitor is whether the warming becomes part of a pattern that reduces sea ice in the Arctic, something scientists are watching closely. "Some climate models predict an ice-free Arctic at least part of the year in the coming decades," Miller said. "If you're going to have an ice-free Arctic and you're going to have big melts in the summertime but also limit ice recovery in the winter, you're going to have to have events like this happen." He continued, "If you have a lot of these events, especially with strong winds that can push that sea ice around and cause some vulnerabilities, if this is a pattern of things to come, it could really become worrisome for the stability of the Arctic." Incidentally, if you want to travel to the relative warmth of the North Pole, you may want to bring a lamp.All stories of Santa Claus and his cheery toy-making elves aside, the North Pole is a brutally cold, inhospitable place that has claimed the lives of countless explorers who attempted to venture there. But I am happy to tell you, where I work is here.

      Help your child decide on the final choice without pressure, and the more voices raising, Argues the selection of a gift in case the list is large. Of course there are steps to follow to make sure the letter gets where it needs to go: 1. 
      Then stick it in an envelope, slap a stamp on it, and drop in the mail to the following address: Santa Claus PO Box 1 Santa Claus, IN 47579 If you'd like something a little more formal, the Santa Claus Museum in Santa Claus, Indiana has a printable letter you can customize and download from their website . As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him." 9After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. 
      A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates. People of all ages write to extend holiday greetings or to express profound wishes that go beyond Christmas presents, such as world peace. 
      The company also introduced the Sprite Boy character at this time. (Photo Credit:  ) (11) “They Knew What I Wanted” — 1945.  With the end of the Second World War came the return to civilian life and homecomings around the world. Santa's secret home was revealed in 1927 on the popular Finnish Children's Hour radio show by Uncle Markus, Markus Rautio.  Uncle Markus explained about the special mountain called Korvatunturi or Ear Mountain.  The mountain looks like a big set of rabbit ears.  Of course, the elves figured out long ago how to use the ears to listen to which children around the world were being naughty.  Drøbak,Norway Many years ago, Santa Claus built a Christmas House (Julehuset) right next to the town square in Drøbak.

      My kids are dressed up and excited to see him and we walk in to find out he's not here. Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!JB "I like how this article gave you step-by-step instructions on how to write to Santa Claus."

      Duralde ultimately concludes that the film is "a train-wreck of a Christmas movie that's so very wrong that you won't be able to tear yourself away from it."[7] Despite all this though the film has developed a cult following amongst those who have grown up with it, and become one of the definitive films to watch at Christmas, often being a seasonal television staple.Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?

      The first Santa ads used a strict-looking Claus, in the vein of Thomas Nast. 
      In a manuscript dated 1605 a merchant in Strasbourg, Germany (at that time) wrote that at Christmas they set up fir trees in the parlors and “hang thereon roses cut out of paper of many colors, apples, wafers, spangle-gold and sugar…” Though the selling of Christmas trees is mentioned back to the mid-1500s in Strasbourg, the custom of decorating the trees may have developed from the medieval Paradise Play.That shift was reflected in the modern depiction of Santa's residence—now often humorously portrayed as a fully mechanized production and distribution facility, equipped with the latest manufacturing technology, and overseen by the elves with Santa and Mrs.
