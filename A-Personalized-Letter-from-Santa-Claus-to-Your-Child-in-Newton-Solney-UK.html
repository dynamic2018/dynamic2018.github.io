      Alban's Anglican Cathedral in Oviedo, Florida A "Chrismon tree" is a Christmas tree decorated with explicitly Christian symbols in white and gold.[67][68] First introduced by North American Lutherans in 1957,[69] the practice has rapidly spread to other Christian denominations,[70] including Anglicans,[71] Catholics,[72] Methodists,[73] and the Reformed.[74] "Chrismon" (plural "Chrismons") was adopted for the type of Christmas decoration and explained as a portmanteau of "CHRISt-MONOgram" (a Christogram).[75][76] Customs and traditions[edit] Setting up and taking down[edit] A candle on a Christmas tree Both setting up and taking down a Christmas tree are associated with specific dates. The role of the Ancient Elf was written with James Cagney in mind; however, with Cagney being very weak in his old age, the legendary actor could not adequately assume the role, despite the fact that he liked the film's overall idea. 
      It was due to this that he used his inheritance to assist the needy, sick, and suffering. The elves and I agreed that you deserve to get something extra-special this year.

      It will be held nine days before Christmas, and means a whole new arra Nine Days to Christmas is, in my opinion, right up there with the very best Caldecott Medal winners and Christmas picture books. How and exactly when the words of 'Veni veni Emmanuel' became united with the funeral hymn is unknown, but certainly it had happened by 1851, when John Mason Neale translated the words from Latin into English (Neale was a prolific translator of hymns and carols from many other languages into English, as well as composing some carols of his own, including 'Good King Wenceslas'.) When Neale wrote the English language version of the carol, he titled it 'Draw nigh, draw nigh, Emmanuel', but later modifications of the text gave us the title and verses we know today.
