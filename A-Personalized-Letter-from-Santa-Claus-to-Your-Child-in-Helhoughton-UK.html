      When asked why there has been so many letters being sent this year, elf Silvia Seger suggested that is was because “the children can write a letter on the internet, we get media [attention] every year and we've been on the travel channel and some others.” Seger is an elf of 10 years. “Keeping a child’s ideas of Santa alive by sending a letter and getting a letter from Santa has to be special,” said Seger.
