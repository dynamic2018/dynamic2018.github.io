      Jordan argues that A Christmas Carol shows what Dickens referred to in a letter to Foster as his "Carol philosophy, cheerful views, sharp anatomisation of humbug, jolly good temper ... and a vein of glowing, hearty, generous, mirthful, beaming reference in everything to Home and Fireside".[53] From a secular viewpoint, the cultural historian Penne Restad suggests that Scrooge's redemption underscores "the conservative, individualistic and patriarchal aspects" of Dickens's "Carol philosophy" of charity and altruism.[54] Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol because of how British social policy treated children at the time, and wished to use the novella as a means to put forward his arguments against it.[55] The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance.[56] The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim.[57] Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.[58] Publication[edit] First edition frontispiece and title page (1843) As the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures of Martin Chuzzlewit,[59] Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits.[30] Production of A Christmas Carol was not without problems.
