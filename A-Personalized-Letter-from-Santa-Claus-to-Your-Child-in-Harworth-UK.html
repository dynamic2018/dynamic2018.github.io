      In the Netherlands and Belgium, Saint Nicolas is aided by a helper or helpers known as Zwarte Piet ("Black Peter"). For over sixty years we've put smiles on the faces of millions of children all over the world with the Original Letter from Santa These personalized letters are filled with more than good wishes from Saint Nick; they're filled with the promise of Christmas, and all its secrets and magic. 
      5 million letters from children and we made sure they all received a reply from Santa himself – and this year’s program shows no sign of slowing down.   For Nadia Chegrinec, mother of three children, 5, 11 and 13, writing to Saint Nick has been a family tradition for a decade.   After the Santa Claus parade, with holiday music playing and hot chocolate flowing, Chegrinec and her children pull out construction paper and sit at the kitchen table to write their notes. To Scott's surprise, his son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) arrives and helps out the elves.
