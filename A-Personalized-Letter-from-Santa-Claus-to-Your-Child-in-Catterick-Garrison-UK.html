      I'm sure some days it's been hard to be good, but I know you've tried and I'm proud of you. Many children would delight in the miracles of Saint Nicholas, and since there so many varying stories of the history of Santa Claus, this is just one more. 
      But I must not see anybody and I must not speak to anybody but you. However in England, the future of the Christmas carol was still far from secure, and in the 17th century a new and very puritanical breed of Christianity under Oliver Cromwell once again tried to eradicate popular songs with pagan, and also Roman Catholic, origins from all celebrations - an attitude which influenced the early pilgrim communities in America too. 
      No one experiences the sheer, unadulterated joy of the Christmas spirit like a child. Some are souvenir like, a lot are themed (including Jim Shore Disney carvings!), some are beautiful works of art. 
      8 million homes with good children were to put out a single chocolate chip cookie and an eight ounce glass of 2% milk, the total calories (needless to say other vitamins and minerals) would be approximately 225 calories (100 for the cookie, give or take, and 125 for the milk, give or take).

      On the other hand, Santa himself better watch out if he finds himself at a Philadelphia Eagles game, lest he get booed and has to dodge snowballs. note  A young man dressed as Santa really did get booed and pelted with snowballs by Eagles fans during the halftime show in a game against the Minnesota Vikings on December 15, 1968, but it was more from frustration by the fanbase at a terrible 2-11 season put forth by the team that year; overall hatred of the team's owner, coach, and quarterback; and the miserable weather (the man himself was a replacement - the original Santa couldn't go due to the weather - and his beard was unconvincing).
