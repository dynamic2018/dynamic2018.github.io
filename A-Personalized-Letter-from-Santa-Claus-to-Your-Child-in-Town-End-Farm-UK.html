As for this Christmas, I have already gone over budget and have only bought for a few people.  This year I bought for myself too (Lego time!).  Last year I bought myself the Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi.  For this year I was going to buy myself a higher end camera but instead settled on buying myself a lot of Lego train items (beware, Lego is suppose to be doing away with the 9 volt Lego trains). 
      The number was mistyped, resulting in children calling the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD) on Christmas Eve instead.You might be surprised, however, to learn she's most likely correct.  You see, even if the envelope bares nothing more than Santa's name inscribed in crayon  but with the utmost sincerity, like thousands do every year that letter will most likely make it to Santa Claus....  But what if Santa could respond to her with a personal letter of his own? 
      This letter should be individualized and may include children's innermost dreams and desires. Joe: (as he’s being repeatedly thrown at a wired fence) He’s not a creep!

      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!)

      Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time!
