      The official site of Santa Claus is called "Father Frost's Mail" . 
      This site gives you the option of five different free Santa letters and five colored backgrounds.It is this organization that is behind the book Letters to Santa Claus, drawing on its archives of missives going back to the 1930s. “It goes from very simple letters to far more expensive wish lists—you watch the progression from ‘I’d like some blocks’ to ‘I’d like a VCR’ and ‘I’d like an iPad,’” says Emily Weisner Thompson, the executive director of the museum who compiled Letters to Santa.

      Note the very narrow slit Albedo changes significantly in the summer when some 10 million km2 of sea ice melts exposing low albedo, dark green, polar water. What's important to monitor is whether the warming becomes part of a pattern that reduces sea ice in the Arctic, something scientists are watching closely. "Some climate models predict an ice-free Arctic at least part of the year in the coming decades," Miller said. "If you're going to have an ice-free Arctic and you're going to have big melts in the summertime but also limit ice recovery in the winter, you're going to have to have events like this happen." He continued, "If you have a lot of these events, especially with strong winds that can push that sea ice around and cause some vulnerabilities, if this is a pattern of things to come, it could really become worrisome for the stability of the Arctic." Incidentally, if you want to travel to the relative warmth of the North Pole, you may want to bring a lamp.All stories of Santa Claus and his cheery toy-making elves aside, the North Pole is a brutally cold, inhospitable place that has claimed the lives of countless explorers who attempted to venture there.
