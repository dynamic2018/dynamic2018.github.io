      I'm sure some days it's been hard to be good, but I know you've tried and I'm proud of you. They can glue pictures of the gifts they want to their letter and then sign their name. 
      But after the Protestant Reformation, saints like Nicholas fell out of favor across much of northern Europe. "That was problematic," Bowler said. "You still love your kids, but now who is going to bring them the gifts?" Bowler said that, in many cases, that job fell to baby Jesus, and the date was moved to Christmas rather than December 6. "But the infant's carrying capacity is very limited, and he's not very scary either," Bowler said. "So the Christ child was often given a scary helper to do the lugging of presents and the threatening of kids that doesn't seem appropriate coming from the baby Jesus." Some of these scary Germanic figures again were based on Nicholas, no longer as a saint but as a threatening sidekick like Ru-klaus (Rough Nicholas), Aschenklas (Ashy Nicholas), and Pelznickel (Furry Nicholas). Digital artists added details that were based on best guesses, including the olive-toned skin most common among Greek Mediterraneans like Nicholas, brown eyes, and the gray hair of a 60-year-old man.

"It rapidly shifted from being a general store and focused really quickly on the tourism market," explains Paul Brown, who today runs the Santa Claus House along with his wife Carissa, the Millers' granddaughter. "A lot of the military people that would come up here would want to buy something from North Pole and send it back, signed by Santa, to their families." The house, which still operates and has a staff of about 50 employees, is far and away North Pole's primary attraction and a huge boon to the local economy. "North Pole is a very, very small community. Have you been burned by companies or uplines in the past? 
      The words of His wisdom, and that of God As many miles on foot would he trod Let Peace be on earth, would be His command, And nothing less than this should we demand!
