Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?

      Another activity could be making their own piñata in the shape they would choose if they has a posada, because art projects are always a hit in the classroom and help the students further understand the story in a crafty way. I will go to the moon and get those things and in a few minutes I will come down the chimney that belongs to the fireplace that is in the hall--if it is a trunk you want--because I couldn't get such a thing as a trunk down the nursery chimney, you know. 
      He wrote the lyrics of the carol in the Huron language, and although the lyrics have been amended since, it seems the intention was to make the Christmas story understandable to the Hurons (who had no knowledge of Palestinian lifestyles) by using analogies from their own lives and spiritual beliefs. Instead of “the annoyance of having to carry letters to the office,” now, as each postman brought mail directly to residents’ doors, it transformed the mail carrier into “a genuine Santa Claus [visiting] households on his beat.” As the postal system became more formalized and efficient, partly in response to the explosion of mail during the Civil War, the cost of postage began dropping in the mid-1860s.

      Father Christmas is now widely seen as synonymous with the Santa Claus figure. Thanks to the author, publishers and NetGalley too for letting me read this book in exchange for this, an honest review. ...more Jun 09, 2015 Amanda rated it liked it The main reason I cannot recommend this book is because everything - all the legends, stories, and details - are treated as fact. 
      For Example you could type in: About Santa Claus Santa holds a huge list of children who have been good throughout the year. In Scandinavia, a jolly elf named Jultomten was thought to deliver gifts in a sleigh drawn by goats.

      A 2004 study found that while in general artificial trees pose little health risk from lead contamination, there do exist "worst-case scenarios" where major health risks to young children exist.[111] A 2008 United States Environmental Protection Agency report found that as the PVC in artificial Christmas trees aged it began to degrade.[112] The report determined that of the 50 million artificial trees in the United States approximately 20 million were 9 or more years old, the point where dangerous lead contamination levels are reached.[112] A professional study on the life-cycle assessment of both real and artificial Christmas trees revealed that one must use an artificial Christmas tree at least 20 years to leave an environmental footprint as small as the natural Christmas tree.[109] Religious issues[edit] A 1931 edition of the Soviet magazine Bezbozhnik, distributed by the League of Militant Atheists, depicting an Orthodox Christian priest being forbidden to cut down a tree for Christmas The Christmas tree was first used by German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strassburg in 1539, under the leadership of the Protestant Reformer, Martin Bucer.[113][114] In the United States, these "German Lutherans brought the decorated Christmas tree with them; the Moravians put lighted candles on those trees."[115][116] When decorating the Christmas tree, many individuals place a star at the top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem, a fact recorded by The School Journal in 1897.[2][117] Professor David Albert Jones of Oxford University writes that in the 19th century, it became popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of Jesus.[3] Under the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union, after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations—along with other religious holidays—were prohibited as a result of the Soviet anti-religious campaign.[118][119][120] The League of Militant Atheists encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, among them being the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays, including Easter; the League established an anti-religious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement.[121] With the Christmas tree being prohibited in accordance with Soviet anti-religious legislation, people supplanted the former Christmas custom with New Year's trees.[120][122] In 1935 the tree was brought back as New Year tree and became a secular, not a religious holiday.

Santa Claus, 68, near his previous home in Lake Tahoe, Nev. (Courtesy of Santa Claus) Like the presidential campaigns, the move to North Pole was largely a publicity ploy (he used to live in the much balmier Lake Tahoe, Nev.) “I thought, ‘What else can I do to make this Santa thing work?'” Stunt or no stunt, North Pole, a town of about 2,100 near Fairbanks has plenty to keep a Santa busy. (The town was christened in 1952 by developers who thought the name might attract more settlers to the chilly corner of central Alaska.) There are about 600 kids living there, and the local oil refinery — the main source of jobs — shut down last year.

      In My Friends Tigger & Pooh: Pooh's Super Sleuth Christmas Movie, Rabbit's biggest Christmas wish is to meet the big guy, but he figures it's impossible, so he puts on his Christmas list what he feels is a more realistic Christmas wish— a subscription to Rutabaga Monthly, which he reads "for the articles of course." In the end, he gets his real wish when the team travels to the North Pole to return a lost baby reindeer and Santa's sack of toys. But what seems unlikely to change is kids’ continued eagerness to correspond with the jolly fellow, and adults’ continued enjoyment in playing him. 
      Once his claim to authorship became public knowledge he tweaked the poem in several places, most notably changing the names of the reindeer formally known as Dunder and Blixem.
