      But what seems unlikely to change is kids’ continued eagerness to correspond with the jolly fellow, and adults’ continued enjoyment in playing him. Paulin handmade a letter from Santa for each and every one of them. “Providing the letters was heartbreaking, delightful and gave my son and I the most interesting Thanksgiving ever,” she said. “My teenage son Mike has been hand painting almost every letter himself, he is driven to get the car fixed and help his grandma.” While her charity work has helped hundreds of needy kids, Paulin still needs help herself.

      Canby quipped that "Santa's workshop must be the world's largest purchaser of low-grade plywood" and that the flyover sequences with Santa "aren't great." The only praise he had for the film's acting was for John Lithgow, who Canby wrote "(gave) the film's only remotely stylish performance."[4] A more recent review by William Mager on BBC.co.uk's review section echoed Canby and Ebert's comments.[5] Soundtrack The soundtrack was composed and conducted by Henry Mancini, composer of the themes from The Pink Panther and Peter Gunn, with veteran lyricist and screenwriter Leslie Bricusse contributing five original songs.
