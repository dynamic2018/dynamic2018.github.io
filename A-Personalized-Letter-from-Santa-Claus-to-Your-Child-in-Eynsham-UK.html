      The store also had a soda fountain, which became a de facto watering hole for the growing local community. Having a Santa set up to take pictures with children is a ritual that dates back at least to 1918.[58] The area set up for this purpose is festively decorated, usually with a large throne, and is called variously "Santa's Grotto", "Santa's Workshop" or a similar term.
