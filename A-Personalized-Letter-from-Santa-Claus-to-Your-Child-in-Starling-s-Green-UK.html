      For two daughters he crept-up to their house at night and threw bags of gold through a bedroom window. Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time! 
      Second World War poster below Santa takes a radical departure from the jolly red suit and dons the dour shades of war. Here are 10 sites that make it easy to be one of Santa's elves.

Each letter also includes a jumbo sticker, proclaiming the bearer to be "on Santa's Good List; an exclusive, keepsake "Santa Dollar;" and a full-color keepsake photo of Santa. 
      In the evenings, Dutch Children sing songs in front of the fire place or in the living room and leave their shoe with a present (drawing for Sinterklaas and Zwarte Piet or a Carrot for Amerigo Sinterklaas' horse) In the mornings they will find their shoe filled with candy and small presents. It's not as full-bodied and rich as muskmelon, though, and they make a nice pairing, as in this big bowl of cut-up melon we took to a dinner party last weekend. 
      A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates.

      Nast’s Santa was much like Moore’s, but a short man instead of a jolly elf, and most likely influenced by the customs of his homeland. In popular culture By the end of the 20th century, the reality of mass mechanized production became more fully accepted by the Western public.[citation needed] Elves had been portrayed as using assembly lines to produce toys early in the 20th century. 
      In December 1773, and again in 1774, a New York newspaper reported that groups of Dutch families had gathered to honor the anniversary of his death. Santa answers every letter that is sent to him, but he has so much mail it usually takes him about three days to write back to you. 
      If you would prefer your business to have a more traditional letter-type approach, and you would like to add stickers and reindeer poop to your letters instead of photos of the children, then this would be a better option for you. You can order the letter of Father Christmas anywhere in the World for the same price.
