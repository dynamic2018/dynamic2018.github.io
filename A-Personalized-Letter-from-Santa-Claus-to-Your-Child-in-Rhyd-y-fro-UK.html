      The Ancient One believed that this man would be the one to whom the elves would grant full immortality, along with the ability to deliver the elves' gifts to children all over the world. Though have no experience to judge, it feels authentic and avoids the cliches or charactertures about another culture one might apprehensively expect from a book of this era. 
      In 1895, President Grover Cleveland decorated the tree at the White House with electric Lights. We leave you with Clement Clarke Moore's poem, popularly known as "'Twas the Night Before Christmas."

      The volunteer program enlists people, businesses and charities to answer kids' letters addressed for Santa Claus and other winter characters, according to a news release. “What better way to celebrate the season than to help Santa and his elves read the thousands and thousands of letters we have on hand?” New York district manager William Schnaars said. Operation Santa in New York City alone responds to more than 500,000 letters a year. This might seem surprising considering how the practice of Santa letters began. 
      Even the biggest package is under $5, which is a great deal compared to some other sites that charge that much or more for a letter alone.
