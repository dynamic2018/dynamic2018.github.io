      Whenever you are naughty and someone points to that mark which your good old Santa Claus's boot made on the marble, what will you say, little sweetheart? The background of the engraving contains now-familiar Santa images including stockings filled with toys and fruit hung over a fireplace. 
      Stores began to advertise Christmas shopping in 1820, and by the 1840s, newspapers were creating separate sections for holiday advertisements, which often featured images of the newly-popular Santa Claus. And you can not send a letter in the truest sense of the word, but just write it and put it under the Christmas tree. 
      Leave it there always in memory of my visit; and whenever you look at it or show it to anybody you must let it remind you to be a good little girl. I really liked this book because it incorporated culture into it and the excitement of traditions. 
      Yet evidence suggests that the transition to a Christmas economy occurred only gradually, with both merchant and consumer acting as architects. The volunteer program enlists people, businesses and charities to answer kids' letters addressed for Santa Claus and other winter characters, according to a news release. “What better way to celebrate the season than to help Santa and his elves read the thousands and thousands of letters we have on hand?” New York district manager William Schnaars said. Operation Santa in New York City alone responds to more than 500,000 letters a year. 
      The building totally screams tourist trap, and it probably does qualify, but once you enter the shop you are transported to the North Pole and Christmas.

      Watts's words had to wait for a hundred years, long after his death, to be paired with the music we find so inspiring today. Nick led to an image of a warm, friendly, pleasantly plump and human Santa.

Sundblom’s Santa debuted in 1931 in Coke ads in The Saturday Evening Post and appeared regularly in that magazine, as well as in Ladies Home Journal, National Geographic, The New Yorker and others.
