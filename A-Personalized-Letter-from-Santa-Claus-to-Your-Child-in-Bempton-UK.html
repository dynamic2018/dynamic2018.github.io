      S., not only did the saint travel in and out of homes via the chimney, so did his mail. This practice survived in Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands after the adoption of Christianity and became associated with Saint Nicholas as a result of the process of Christianization. 
      How to Create a Letter From Santa at Free Santa Letters There are quite a few websites out there that you can use to create a letter from Santa, but my favorite one that I come back to year after year is Free Santa Letters.

      At my partner's house, Santa always left a random number of presents, and they were carefully wrapped in paper that was different from any of the other paper on the other gifts.
