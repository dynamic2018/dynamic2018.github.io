      In the beginning this creature didn't give presents but demanded them. On the other hand, tiny fans and paper lamps were used during Christmas in Japan. 
      The Coca-Cola Santa was used in advertising to support the war effort. You write a letter to Santa by inputting a bit of info such as the child's name and location and name a couple of things that are on the Christmas list. 
      15 for Santa’s helpers to get the response back to your child in time for Christmas.  The agency estimates that it’ll handle some 16 billion letters, cards and packages this holiday season. The busiest mailing day is expected to be Dec. We got there really early and Santa wasn't in yet. 
      Twitter will use this to make your timeline better. But after the Protestant Reformation, saints like Nicholas fell out of favor across much of northern Europe. "That was problematic," Bowler said. "You still love your kids, but now who is going to bring them the gifts?" Bowler said that, in many cases, that job fell to baby Jesus, and the date was moved to Christmas rather than December 6. "But the infant's carrying capacity is very limited, and he's not very scary either," Bowler said. "So the Christ child was often given a scary helper to do the lugging of presents and the threatening of kids that doesn't seem appropriate coming from the baby Jesus." Some of these scary Germanic figures again were based on Nicholas, no longer as a saint but as a threatening sidekick like Ru-klaus (Rough Nicholas), Aschenklas (Ashy Nicholas), and Pelznickel (Furry Nicholas). 
      After a few stopgap attempts, the Post Office Department (as the United States Postal Service was known until 1971), saw little other option but to permanently change the policy in 1913, allowing local charity groups to answer the letters, as long as they got the approval of the local postmaster.
