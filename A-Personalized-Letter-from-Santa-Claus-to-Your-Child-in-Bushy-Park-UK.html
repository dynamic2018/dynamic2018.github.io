      Carline Jean/Staff Photographer (Carline Jean / Sun Sentinel) Wearing an elf hat, Boca Raton business owner Sarah Blain snagged a Shark Tank investment in her personalized Santa letter business from Lori Greiner, an inventor and entrepreneur known as the "Queen of QVC."

      OK, now for my Lego shopping trip.  Wait, you clicked and ordered the Santa letter, right?  Well, do that first.  Please.  This is not a totally selfless act on my part, I’m not pretending that it is.  Everyone is trying to earn money, and well, though I won’t be writing the letters you will be helping me pay for my Lego trains.  In exchange, I will post pictures of my Legos. If you would prefer your business to have a more traditional letter-type approach, and you would like to add stickers and reindeer poop to your letters instead of photos of the children, then this would be a better option for you.
