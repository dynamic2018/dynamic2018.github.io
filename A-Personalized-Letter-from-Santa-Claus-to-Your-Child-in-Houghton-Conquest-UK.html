      Kids from all the World write letters to Santa Claus in North Pole. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, it is common for children to leave him rice porridge with cinnamon sugar instead. 
      In later stories the helper represented the conquered Devil, who was defeated either by Odin or his assistant Nörwi, the black father of the night. The record low temperature at the South Pole is âˆ’117° F, recorded on June 23, 1982, while the record high is only 7. 
      Dress up your pets and babies as this jolly character and the Christmas cheer will never end. Use an unusual transportation method to get to the airport (limo, antique car). 
      At around the same time, in the Hindu Puranas, it became personified under the name Dhruva ("immovable, fixed"). Nowadays, however, people in many nations have Santa on their own naughty list, either because he represents the commercialization of Christmas at the expense of Christ or simply because he's not a local. "In places like the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Austria, and Latin America, they all have very strong anti-Santa movements because they are trying to preserve their native Christmas gift bringers and customs, and protect them from the North American Santa," he said. 
      If game night is a thing at your lily pad, dealing out the surprise during the game will make everyone hoppy. Spell it out during a game of hangman, or draw Spaceship Earth in Pictionary.

Santa did not have reindeer until December 23, 1823 when Clement Moore published his poem "Twas the Night Before Christmas." This was the first mention of how Santa Claus flew through the night.

Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?
