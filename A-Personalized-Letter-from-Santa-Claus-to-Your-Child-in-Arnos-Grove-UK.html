      Santa Claus gets over 1 million letters each year, so Canada Post reserved a special postal code for Santa using Canada Post's addressing system. In fact, many of the Rankin/Bass stop-motion "Animagic" specials were produced in Japan.

      The grave was for Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose job was given as a meal man—a corn merchant; Dickens misread the inscription as "mean man".[39][n 6] When Dickens was young he lived near a tradesman's premises with the sign "Goodge and Marney", which may have provided the name for Scrooge's former business partner.[41] For the chained Marley, Dickens had remembered a visit he had made to the Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he saw—and was affected by—seeing fettered prisoners.[34] For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the time A Christmas Carol was written.[42][n 7] The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present were inspired by the children Dickens had seen on his visit to a ragged School in the East End of London.[17] Themes[edit] Ignorance and Want from the original edition, 1843 The transformation of Scrooge is central to the story.[44] Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character, but who then grows into one who "possess[es] an emotional depth [and] a regret for lost opportunities".[45] Some writers, including Grace Moore, the Dickens scholar, consider that there is a Christian theme running through A Christmas Carol, and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the Christian concept of redemption.[46][n 8] Dickens's biographer, Claire Tomalin sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that "even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man".[48] Dickens's attitudes towards organised religion were complex,[n 9] although he based his beliefs and principles within the New Testament.[51] Dickens's statement that Marley "had no bowels" is a reference to the "bowels of compassion" mentioned in I John, the reason for his eternal damnation.[52][n 10] Other writers, including Kelly, see that Dickens put forward a "secular vision of this sacred holiday".[10] The Dickens scholar John O. For instance, writer Austin Cline posed the question: "Is it not possible that kids would find at least as much pleasure in knowing that parents are responsible for Christmas, not a supernatural stranger?"[124] Others, however, see no harm in the belief in Santa Claus. 
      And he said the truths of Santa claus , then I was disappionted much. You simply have the parents fill out a questionnaire (included) to supply you with the information you need.

What of the other places that claim Santa lives within their borders? "Rovaniemi recognizes that there are many other places that make the claim," Henri Anund, a communications officer for Rovaniemi tourism, wrote in an e-mail, "but Rovaniemi is the only Official Hometown of Santa Claus, and Santa Claus Office in Santa Claus Village is the only place in the world where you can meet Santa Claus 365 days a year." Rovaniemi also doles out letters from Santa to children all around the world (for a small fee).
