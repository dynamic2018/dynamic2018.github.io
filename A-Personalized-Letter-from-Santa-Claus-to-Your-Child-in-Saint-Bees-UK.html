      So, you can see we're keeping busy, but we're looking forward to visiting !! Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time!

The toy airplane replies: "You're gonna fit right in here!" and falls on the ground laughing.[citation needed] Starting in 2011, there have been several Bing.com commercials, filmed to look like the same stop-motion style as the special, which feature several characters including Rudolph, Yukon Cornelius, Hermey, the Bumble, and the Misfit Toys.[citation needed] A 2012 commercial for Windows phone features Bumble the Abominable Snowman (with his full set of teeth), speed-dating and getting advice from friends through Live Tiles.
