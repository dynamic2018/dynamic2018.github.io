      I have gone through several Santa Clause letters programs and none are quite as complete as this system. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      Santa needs your help to create a more personalized experience for your child this Christmas! Always write such letters detailed, explain to the child that Santa Claus is not interesting to read his letter, in which the two lines. 
      In a video, he'll comment on whether you've been naughty or nice before he does some exercises to stay limber for Christmas Eve.
