      Once all the gifts were wrapped, I called a Frog Family meeting. But I had trouble with those letters which you dictated through your mother and the nurses, for I am a foreigner and cannot read English writing well. 
      Please note, these are online letters displayed on northpole.com letterhead. (Click here for an example.) Northpole.com does not offer letter mailing services. They have been with us for about 2 1/2 years and have all but given up on dreams and fairy tales. 
      Undo Letter from Santa‏ @asantaletter 9 Dec 2016 More Thanks. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      In the past, many local television stations in the United States and Canada likewise claimed they "tracked Santa Claus" in their own metropolitan areas through the stations' meteorologists. But the fact that we grew up does not mean that we have to stop believing in miracles. 
      Because, after all, it’s really not about what the gift is or how it’s wrapped but who is their to share the moment with you on Christmas morning.
