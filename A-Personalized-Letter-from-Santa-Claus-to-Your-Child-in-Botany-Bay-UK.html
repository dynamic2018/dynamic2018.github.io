      Let him or her put it into an envelope addressed simply “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE.”  Later, secretly open the letter and write a response from Santa. USPS suggests writing it on the back of your child’s letter so he or she can see the original along with Santa’s response. “When responding as Santa, make the response as personal as possible by highlighting your child’s accomplishments over the past year,” USPS suggests. “For example, helping around the house, receiving good grades in a particular subject at school or participating in community service activities.” Then, put it in an envelope addressed to your child with “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE” as the return address.  Add the proper postage ― USPS suggests one of its new holiday-themed stamps ― then put it inside a larger envelope, also with the necessary postage. Your browser may also contain add-ons that send automated requests to our search engine. 
      If for no other reason, you've got to stop by to get some pictures of Christmas in July. The letter comes with the printable envelope to match.

      In Scandinavia, a jolly elf named Jultomten was thought to deliver gifts in a sleigh drawn by goats. Santa letters are mailed during the first part of December, to ensure delivery before Christmas Day no matter where you or your special child are located. 
      I told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture. This Santa Paws keeps the reindeer in line when Santa’s not around.

      Christmas cards also made modest but suitable presents. '[W]orn out from choosing gifts' for old friends and school mates, one writer noted, 'we usually fall back on Christmas cards, which constitute one of the most precious and at the same time inexpensive contributions of these latter days to the neglected cause of sentiment'.

      Then when I say "Good-by and a merry Christmas to my little Susie Clemens," you must say "Good-bye, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much and please tell that little Snow Flake I will look at her star tonight and she must look down here" ... and every fine night I will look at her star and say, 'I know somebody up there and like her, too.'" It is poignant to read this letter. Getting Started with Your Santa Clause Letters Biz First off, you'll need to decide which holidays you want to offer personalized cards for. 
      But when I was growing up my parents didn't wrap Santa's gifts, they just placed them around the tree/living room so when we woke up we could see everything. Questions asked while composing the letters are: -What is your Name? -How old are you? -Are you a boy or a girl? -Have you been naughty or nice? -What do you want for Christmas? -Do you have anything more to say to Santa? 
      Cards must be bought and then must be signed And addresses and mailed to reach friends on time.
