      Sending the Letters to Santa Claus' Address Now that your child has written their letter to Santa, wouldn't it be fun for them to get a reply? Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      Credit to the creator which is focaclipart.wordpress.com is required if you plan on using this clip art on your projects. When he brings you each item, he earns a puzzle piece you’ve prepared ahead of time (more on that in a minute). 
      Anyway, Santa Claus lives at the North Pole and that's that and I'm not moving!  Besides, I like my Canadian postal code: H0H 0H0.  (HO HO HO!) Ok, ok, Santa Claus does have other places around the world.  I'll tell you about them too.  (Why do I suddenly feel a bit like his travel agent?)  He does visit them every year (kind of like having summer homes -- does he think he's Brad Pitt or something?)  But I like staying at the North Pole.  I'm nice and grumpy right here, thank you! We would never have someone thing like this back home (Arizona). 
      Whether he's a jolly old man with a red suit and beard or an elder man clad in a green fur cloak and wearing a wreath of ivy, his mission is clear -- bringing holiday cheer. The templates are very personalized, allowing you to fill in facts about the child such as their name, age, best friend's name, favorite food, and all kinds of other things.
