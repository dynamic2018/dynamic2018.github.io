      In 1939, May wrote a Christmas-themed story-poem to help bring holiday traffic into his store. Now, children can also send their letters to Santa via email. 
      Written for his children in 1823, the family poem was later published for the general public and included what became the now famous picture of Santa Claus by Thomas Nast ( see below right ). In Australia, for example, children are promised to get reply letters from Santa so long as they post their own to the North Pole 9999 before December 17th.

"That was problematic," Bowler said. "You still love your kids, but now who is going to bring them the gifts?" Bowler said that, in many cases, that job fell to baby Jesus, and the date was moved to Christmas rather than December 6. "But the infant's carrying capacity is very limited, and he's not very scary either," Bowler said.
