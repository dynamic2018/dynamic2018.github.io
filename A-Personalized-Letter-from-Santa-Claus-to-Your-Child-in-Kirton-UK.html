      As Father Christmas has been increasingly merged into the image of Santa Claus, that has been changed to the more commonly known red suit.[9] One school in the seaside town of Brighton banned the use of a red suit erroneously believing it was only indicative of the Coca-Cola advertising campaign. It was one of the first movie roles for the diminutive stage actor. 
      His online screen-name is "MyPoleIsNorth." Santa has his own religion, called Santanism and has been accused of putting Santanicmessages in Christmas Carols. Allen and Short had previously worked together in the 1997 Disney comedy feature film, Jungle 2 Jungle.
