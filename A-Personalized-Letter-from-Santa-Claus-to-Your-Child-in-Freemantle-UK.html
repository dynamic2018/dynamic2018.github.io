      While Saint Nicholas was originally portrayed wearing bishop's robes, today Santa Claus is generally depicted as a plump, jolly, white-bearded man wearing a red coat with white collar and cuffs, white-cuffed red trousers, and black leather belt and boots (images of him rarely have a beard with no mustache). Santa Claus as a character is widespread even in countries that aren't Christian, like Japan and China.

      You will also need to decide how you are going to send out your personalized letters from Santa Claus. For example, University of Texas psychology professor Jacqueline Woolley helped conduct a study that found, to the contrary, that children seemed competent in their use of logic, evidence, and comparative reasoning even though they might conclude that Santa Claus or other fanciful creatures were real: The adults they count on to provide reliable information about the world introduce them to Santa. 
      All year long, the Elves were all kidnapped from their homes and forced into slavery to cheerily design and build a variety of increasingly advanced deadly weapons, singing happy songs and eating ever so delightful cafeteria foods. Christmas is the time when Santa Claus and Puzzle Man climb into their Jeeps and drive from house to house visiting all the sleeping people of the world. 
      The elves and I have been busy building toys and getting my sleigh ready for the big trip. They get sweets in a bag if they were good, and a golden colored birch switch if not. 
      Two separate musical montages follow, each depicting Santa delivering toys across the centuries, and demonstrating how a great deal of the mythos around him is established.
