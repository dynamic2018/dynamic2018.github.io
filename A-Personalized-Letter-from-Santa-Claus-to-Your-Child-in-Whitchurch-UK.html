      Where does Santa live?  Where doesn't Santa live!  It's like Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous with him!  Santa Claus has homes all around the world.  Here are some of the places he lives: Santa's main home is at The North Pole (of course, silly!) -- it's in Canada. She will be 2 in February, so this will be a fun Christmas for her. 
      Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time! Help him pack up all of these gifts so he can make his deliveries on time. 
      Especially when they see that it was signed by Santa Claus! Note that this date may change from year to year, depending on where weekends fall and the volume of letters experienced.The   North   Pole   is   NOT   in   Alaska!   The   North   Pole   is   also   NOT   in   North   Pole,   Indiana   so   why   should   we   postmark our   letters   from   there?   If   the   North   Pole   was   in   Alaska   then   we   could   take   our   kids   there   and   disturb   Santa   all   year   long.   That   is   not the   case.   The   North   Pole   is   secluded   where   it   is   very   hard   to   disturb   Santa.   Why   would   he   put   his   workshop   in   the   middle   of   a   city in   Alaska   anyway?   The   North   Pole   is   in   the   middle   of   the   Arctic   Ocean.   In   summer   the   temperatures   are   near   0   centigrade   and there   is   light.   This   is   when   Santa   Claus   sleeps   and   rest   most   of   the   year.   He   also   likes   to   travel   the   world   so   he   may   not   even   be home   during   the   summer.   In   winter   the   temperature   is   about   -30   centigrade   and   it   is   dark.   Under   the   cover   of   this   darkness   is when   the   workshop   comes   alive   making   toys   and   begins   preparing   for   the   big   night.   It   is   often   said   that   the   Reindeer   practice   their flying under the cover of this darkness and that's why they have never been spotted flying in the daylight.
