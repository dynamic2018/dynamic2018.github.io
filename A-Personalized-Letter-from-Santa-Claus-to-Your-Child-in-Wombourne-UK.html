      For many years, those who could afford to would express their Christmas spirit by lighting candles on trees. “Generally, the tree was set up in the parlor and when all the family would come down to see the tree, dad or grandpa would light up all the candles,” John Hanssen, an collector of Christmas-related antiques, tells TIME. “You’d look at it for a few seconds and blow them out.” Candles were lit to “signify the light of Jesus,” according to Hanssen, 46, who is a member of the Golden Glow of Christmas Past, an international organization for Christmas history.He is then sent to Lapland, then to the North Pole, then they generally send letters without an address.
