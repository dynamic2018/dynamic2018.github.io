To   ensure   prompt   delivery,   OfficialNorthPoleMail.com    highly   recommends   ordering   early   and   upgrading   your   shipping   to Priority   Mail.      We   do   not   suggest   delaying   your   shipping   date,   instead   we   suggest   receiving   the   package   early   and   having   an adult   remove   it   from   the   mailbox   and   put   it   up   for   safe   keeping   and   when   the   time   is   right   then   simply   put   the   letter   or package   back   into   the   mailbox   and   watch   the   Christmas   magic   happen.      That   way   you   are   not   on   pins   and   needles   waiting for   the   mail   to   arrive   and   you   can   choose   the   best   time   to   spring   the   surprise   and   avoid   any   delays   that   the   holiday   mail system may bring.

      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? You could be submitting a large number of automated requests to our search engine. 
      That's part of the magic for me, especially in a culture where we've become so commercialized and hooked into manufactured icons.
