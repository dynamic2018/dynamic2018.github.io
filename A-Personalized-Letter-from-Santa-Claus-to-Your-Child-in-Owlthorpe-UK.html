      It's inexpensive, too, at less than $30 for one size fits most. Here's some advice on how to help the Jolly Old Elf send a Santa letter to your little one, complete with a postmark from the North Pole. 
      Santa is becoming increasingly tired by the workload of toys he must deliver, combined with the ever-growing population of the planet. You want your children to know you will always answer questions truthfully. 
      Let him or her put it into an envelope addressed simply “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE.”  Later, secretly open the letter and write a response from Santa. USPS suggests writing it on the back of your child’s letter so he or she can see the original along with Santa’s response. “When responding as Santa, make the response as personal as possible by highlighting your child’s accomplishments over the past year,” USPS suggests. “For example, helping around the house, receiving good grades in a particular subject at school or participating in community service activities.” Then, put it in an envelope addressed to your child with “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE” as the return address.  Add the proper postage ― USPS suggests one of its new holiday-themed stamps ― then put it inside a larger envelope, also with the necessary postage. Have you sent a letter to Santa on this site previously? 
      This would really be great for a little one to receive.

      In fact, there are quite a few indicators that his life story was simply recycled from those of Pagan gods.And adults do a great job of duping them.[123] —  Jacqueline Wooley Woolley posited that it is perhaps "kinship with the adult world" that causes children not to be angry that they were lied to for so long.[123] However, the criticism about this deception is not that it is a simple lie, but a complicated series of very large lies.[124] Objections include that it is unethical for parents to lie to children without good cause, and that it discourages healthy skepticism in children.[124] With no greater good at the heart of the lie, some have charged that it is more about the parents than it is about the children.
