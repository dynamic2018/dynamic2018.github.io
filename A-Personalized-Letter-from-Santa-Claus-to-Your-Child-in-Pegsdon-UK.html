      Did you know Santa did not save the Misfit Toys in the original 1964 stop motion animation “Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer?” According to the article ‘10 Things You Didn’t Know About Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer’ by Amanda Ferris, angry letters from children demanded the Misfit Toys be helped and thus the short scene that showed Santa and Rudolf making good on their promise to go back to the island and deliver the Misfits to homes was added and has been shown since 1965. If you did, you remember the butterflies-in-your-stomach feeling you got when you saw that envelope with its genuine North Pole postmark. 
      But I must not see anybody and I must not speak to anybody but you. I've talked about it with one of my elves and he's going to search the workshop to see if he can find it for you!

So now, any time Santa wants to get into a home without a chimney (and even some homes WITH chimneys because it's so much easier to go through the door), he simply looks for a special key left near the door or hanging around the doorknob with a note for him.

      If you did, you remember the butterflies-in-your-stomach feeling you got when you saw that envelope with its genuine North Pole postmark. Nicholas made his first inroads into American popular culture towards the end of the 18th century. 
      Many children and even adults prefer to buy simple stockings and they decorate it with patch works of Christmas symbols, tinsels and stars. Even the biggest package is under $5, which is a great deal compared to some other sites that charge that much or more for a letter alone.
