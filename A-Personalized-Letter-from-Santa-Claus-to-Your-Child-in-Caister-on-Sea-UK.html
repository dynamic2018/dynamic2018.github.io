      Santa authentic down to 13-year-old beard By Dan Rice, Staff Writer After thirty-two round trips on the Alaska Highway, a 29-year stint as a cook at Clear Air Force Station and more than 40 years in Alaska, Collie Collins seems the proudest about another enduring aspect of himself. "That's real; that's 13 years old," he said to a visitor of the Santa Claus House in North Pole last week who couldn't resist testing whether Santa's beard is just part of a costume.

Thus Thomas Nast, a very real and now historical newspaper artist, was the VERY FIRST PERSON to paint the first definitive portrait of our present day Santa Claus in 1870.Once the Yule season rolls around, you can't shake a sprig of mistletoe without seeing images of a chubby man in a red suit.

Can I email Santa Claus and get a reply? But having read my kid the riot act about needing to write an old-fashioned letter (he originally asked if he could just email Santa a link to his Amazon wish list!), I'm not willing to go that route.
