      Traditionally, Christmas trees were not brought in and decorated until Christmas Eve (24 December)[citation needed] or, in the traditions celebrating Christmas Eve rather than the first day of Christmas, 23 December, and then removed the day after Twelfth Night (5 January); to have a tree up before or after these dates was even considered bad luck,[citation needed] and that to avoid bad luck from affecting the house's residents, the tree must be left up until after the following Twelfth Night passes. Boniface believed that he saw a triangular shape amid the fractured tree. 
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?

      This stilla maris was later misread as stella maris; the misreading is also found in the manuscript tradition of Isidore's Etymologiae (7th century);[3] it probably arises in the Carolingian era; a late 9th-century manuscript of Jerome's text still has stilla, not stella,[4] but Paschasius Radbertus, also writing in the 9th century, makes an explicit reference to the "Star of the Sea" metaphor, saying that Mary is the "Star of the Sea" to be followed on the way to Christ, "lest we capsize amid the storm-tossed waves of the sea."[5] The name stella polaris was coined in the Renaissance, even though at that time it was well recognized that it was several degrees away from the celestial pole; Gemma Frisius in the year 1547 determined this distance as 3°7'.[6] An explicit identification of Mary as stella maris with the North Star (Polaris) becomes evident in the title Cynosura seu Mariana Stella Polaris (i.e. "Cynosure, or the Marian Polar Star"), a collection of Marian poetry published by Nicolaus Lucensis (Niccolo Barsotti de Lucca) in 1655.
