      From the perspective of someone observing from the North Pole, this northern pole star would appear directly overhead. Your mama can show you that star and you will say: “Little Snow Flake,” (for that is the child’s name) “I’m glad you got that furniture, for you need it more than I.” That is, you must write that, with your own hand, and Snow Flake will write you an answer.

      When Ak, Master Woodsman of the World, exposed him to the misery and poverty of children in the outside world, Santa determined to find a way to bring joy into the lives of all children, and eventually invented toys as a principal means.

      Especially when they see that it was signed by Santa Claus!Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!As everyone knows, this is Santa’s busiest time of year ― and it’s tough for the big guy to answer every Christmas letter himself.  So if your kids want a letter from Santa Claus (or maybe you want one yourself!), you may have to take matters into your own hands.  The United States Postal Service has some of Santa’s helpers standing by at its Anchorage post office, ready to return letters to kids complete with a “NORTH POLE” postmark.  Here’s how it works: Have your child write a letter to Santa.

      By 1856 a northern provincial newspaper contained an advert alluding casually to them,[40] as well as reporting the accidental death of a woman whose dress caught fire as she lit the tapers on a Christmas tree.[41] They had not yet spread down the social scale though, as a report from Berlin in 1858 contrasts the situation there where "Every family has its own" with that of Britain, where Christmas trees were still the preserve of the wealthy or the "romantic".[42] Their use at public entertainments, charity bazaars and in hospitals made them increasingly familiar however, and in 1906 a charity was set up specifically to ensure even poor children in London slums 'who had never seen a Christmas tree' would enjoy one that year.[43] Anti-German sentiment after World War I briefly reduced their popularity[44] but the effect was short-lived[45] and by the mid-1920s the use of Christmas trees had spread to all classes.[46] In 1933 a restriction on the importation of foreign trees led to the 'rapid growth of a new industry' as the growing of Christmas trees within Britain became commercially viable due to the size of demand.[47] By 2013 the number of trees grown in Britain for the Christmas market was approximately 8 million[48] and their display in homes, shops and public spaces a normal part of the Christmas season. Snider, a reviewer, said that Allen did The Santa Clause "the first time with enthusiasm, the second time with affection, and the third time for a paycheck."[1] Kyle Smith wrote "We're getting a turkey and a ham for the holidays. [...] Santa is so dumb he should be demoted to cleaning up after Geoffrey the Giraffe at Toys 'R' Us." Manohla Dargis dismissed the movie (in a three-paragraph review) as "squeaky clean, but you might die of boredom." Finally, Nathaniel Bell wrote off the film as "holiday filler, stuffed with unearned emotion and trite sentimentality." In the UK, Mark Kermode described it in 2006 on BBC Radio Five Live as "the cinematic equivalent of tertiary syphilis".
