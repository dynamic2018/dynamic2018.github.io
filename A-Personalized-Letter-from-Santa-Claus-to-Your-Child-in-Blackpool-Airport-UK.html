      Sundblom created his final version of Santa Claus in 1964, but for several decades to follow, Coca-Cola advertising featured images of Santa based on Sundblom’s original works.

      These fun and festive characters add a little life to your Christmas tree display and give your kids something to play with until their own presents arrive. Next week we'll be talking about how to set up a business.
