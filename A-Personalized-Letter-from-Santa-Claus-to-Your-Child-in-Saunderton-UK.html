      But, When Christmas Eve turned foggy and Santa worried that he wouldn’t be able to deliver gifts that night, the former outcast saved Christmas by leading the sleigh by the light of his red nose. His explains in the letter that his father, a deputy sheriff, was shot and killed by gangsters and his new stepdad “is so mean he never buys me anything.” Such sad or funny stories are not unusual when reading through Santa letters, going back to the 19th century. 
      However, a volunteer organization in North Pole does respond to such letters. It is to be noted that until the 1880s, Christmas tree decorations had mainly been the creative domain of family and friends and the only ornaments available in the market were German hand-cast lead and hand-blown glass decorations. 
      While post offices throughout the country managed most of these answering campaigns, the city of Santa Claus has taken its own approach. Among the shops you can find designer shops and famous Finnish and Lapland brands outlets � Marttiini, Iittala, Taigakoru � Marimekko. 
      Ordering Information What types of payment do you accept online? Imagine the thrill your child will feel, realizing that Santa has taken a special interest in him or her. 
      Their presents usually involved one or two bigger items and a couple small or practical items.

      Tad's had a stuffed Mickey Mouse inside and Lily's had a stuffed Minnie Mouse. What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus? 
      I read a lot of letters, and yours is very special indeed! Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time!
