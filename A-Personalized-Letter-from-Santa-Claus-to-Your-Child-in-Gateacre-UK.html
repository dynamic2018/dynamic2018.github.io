      Around 14,000 AD, when Vega is only 4° from the North Pole, Canopus will be only 8° from the South Pole and thus circumpolar on the latitude of Bali (8°S).[13] Other planets[edit] Pole stars of other planets are defined analogously: they are stars (brighter than 6th magnitude, i.e., visible to the naked eye under ideal conditions) that most closely coincide with the projection of the planet's axis of rotation onto the Celestial sphere.If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons.

      To create the North Pole postmark, use a red circle graphic with a white interior and print "North Pole" inside the circle in green.Anyway, if you do not believe in magic, then there will not be any sense. 
      I will go to the moon and get those things and in a few minutes I will come down the chimney that belongs to the fireplace that is in the hall--if it is a trunk you want--because I couldn't get such a thing as a trunk down the nursery chimney, you know . . . . We learned that all the time parents put toys and sweets under the Christmas tree and stopped believing in miracles. 
      But in the letter which you dictated there were some words which I could not make out for certain, and one or two small orders which I could not fill because we ran out of stock. Do not take this occupation as nonsense or trivia.

      The volunteer program enlists people, businesses and charities to answer kids' letters addressed for Santa Claus and other winter characters, according to a news release. “What better way to celebrate the season than to help Santa and his elves read the thousands and thousands of letters we have on hand?” New York district manager William Schnaars said. Operation Santa in New York City alone responds to more than 500,000 letters a year. Europeans liked to use small Christmas trees of 4 feet height where as Americans preferred gigantic Christmas trees, length of which varied enormously. 
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? His cartoon, which appeared in Harper’s Weekly, depicted Santa as a rotund, cheerful man with a full, white beard, holding a sack laden with toys for lucky children. 
      The best evidence we have of this comes from a letter that Twain penned for his 3 year old daughter, in which he poses as Santa Claus replying to the young girl’s Christmas list.
