      Kids today have even more reasons for getting excited by cards and letters personally addressed to them in the mailbox. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      Eventually, the idea emerged that he had numerous elves responsible for making the toys, but the toys were still handmade by each individual elf working in the traditional manner. The earliest publication which survives today is from 'Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern' edited by William B Sandys and Davies Gilbert in 1833. 
      Ask Santa to implement all his plans, health, luck, and perhaps some gifts.
