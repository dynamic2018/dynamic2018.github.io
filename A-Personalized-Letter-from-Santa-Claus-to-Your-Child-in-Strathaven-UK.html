      French Christmas Carols French Christmas carols are also a popular name in the lot, of which very popular ones get even translated into English. The other thing that I also would like is the (name of the gift you want). 
      How the Letter From Santa Will Be Customized For Your Child The letter from Santa Claus will be customized with your child's name, gender, achievements, age, town, friend, and presents they want. Good luck on getting your children's personalized letter service started! 
      The use and popularity of carols increased throughout the sixteenth century and into the seventeenth century, only to come to a screeching halt, at least in English-speaking countries, with the dissolution of the British monarchy. Its not easy to keep the magic of Christmas alive from gifts that are too expensive to the problem of keeping Santa Claus alive in your kids minds. 
      Rudolph had previously been ostracized by the other reindeer for his nose, which glowed a bright red, but this very feature made Rudolph a perfect candidate to guide Santa's sleigh through the fog. Although the following closings for personal letters may sound overly affectionate to English speakers, they are quite commonly used: Un abrazo (literally, a hug) Un fuerte abrazo (literally, a strong hug) Cariñosos saludos (roughly, kind regards) Afectuosamente (affectionately) The following are common with close friends or family members, although there are many others that can be used: Besos y abrazos (literally, kisses and hugs) Besos (literally, kisses) Con todo mi cariño (with all my caring) Con todo mi afecto (with all my affection) In business correspondence, the most common ending, used in much the same way as "sincerely" in English, is atentamente. 
      Do this carefully so Santa will know where to find you and so he can write a letter back.
