Let the fairy-tale character understand that he is dealing with a polite supplicant, and not with an ill-mannered extortionist.

      Thus, we can write a letter to Santa Claus for free, well, of course, except for a small postage on the envelope, and postage stamps. Therein lay the significance of the New York Sun's famous discourse on the spiritual meaning of Santa. 
      Some elves have been tuning up my sleigh so it's ready to fly on Christmas Eve, while others have been putting the finishing touches on all the toys in the toy workshop. OK, now for my Lego shopping trip.  Wait, you clicked and ordered the Santa letter, right?  Well, do that first.  Please.  This is not a totally selfless act on my part, I’m not pretending that it is.  Everyone is trying to earn money, and well, though I won’t be writing the letters you will be helping me pay for my Lego trains.  In exchange, I will post pictures of my Legos.
