      Nast continued to draw Santa for 30 years, changing the color of his coat from tan to the red he’s known for today. This painting was produced by a new advertising agency for Coca-Cola , McCann-Erickson. (Photo Credit:  ) (16) “Refreshing Surprise” — 1959. 
      This is the Santa everyone remembers from all those childhood pictures at the shopping center. C: Throughout the Ellis the Elephant series, Ellis explores the pivotal moments that have shaped our nation. 
      Well, this time of year – this time we call “Christmas” – gets very busy and kind of crazy.  Everyone just focuses on “want, want, want.”  Have you been telling your Mommy and Daddy what you want for Christmas?  It’s ok to want a few things, but I’ve seen people – grown ups and kiddos – get very selfish with all the stuff they want.  They want so many things that they forget the whole reason we even have Christmas….  Jesus – God’s son who was born a long, long, long time ago… The very first “Christmas present” ever given to the whole big world. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and even older siblings can use professional websites to personalize and create beautiful letters that your child will want to keep forever. 
      If you did, you remember the butterflies-in-your-stomach feeling you got when you saw that envelope with its genuine North Pole postmark. You MAY NOT sell the printed materials from these files. 
      You will find that I made no mistakes about the things which you and the baby ordered in your own letters--I went down your chimney at midnight when you were asleep and delivered them all myself--and kissed both of you, too . . . .

      Santa Letter from Sweet Paper Trail - In this fill-in-the-blank Santa letter, kids will get to fill out their name, gifts they want, and check off whether they've been naughty or nice. At the end, a letter from 1 Rudolph Way will pop up and summarize what Santa said.Santa Claus Village in Rovaniemi, northern Finland, is one of the main attractions, and for many people it is the main reason to visit Finland. 
      On the other hand, Santa himself better watch out if he finds himself at a Philadelphia Eagles game, lest he get booed and has to dodge snowballs. note  A young man dressed as Santa really did get booed and pelted with snowballs by Eagles fans during the halftime show in a game against the Minnesota Vikings on December 15, 1968, but it was more from frustration by the fanbase at a terrible 2-11 season put forth by the team that year; overall hatred of the team's owner, coach, and quarterback; and the miserable weather (the man himself was a replacement - the original Santa couldn't go due to the weather - and his beard was unconvincing). A Wendy's in North Pole, AK has also claimed to have a "sleigh fly through".[6] Each Nordic country claims Santa's residence to be within their territory. 
      In 1881, political cartoonist Thomas Nast drew on Moore’s poem to create the first likeness that matches our modern image of Santa Claus. His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow. 
      He was chosen by many groups, of people and countries as their patron saint.
