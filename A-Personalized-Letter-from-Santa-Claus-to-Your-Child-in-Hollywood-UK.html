      The graphic can be on a sticker or can be printed directly on the envelope. The day before christmas, I decided to wait Sant a claus who would come to me to give me a christmas present. 
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? Santa Claus brought you loads of presents this year, but the horrible zombies didn't get anything. 
      Christmas morning we always had gifts from Santa but they were smaller, less expensive items like board games, arts and craft activities, dolls, action figures. This online program allows you to create unlimited letters from Santa Claus, with coordinating envelopes and Nice List certificates. 
      Using a similar rhyme pattern to Moore’s “‘Twas the Night Before Christmas,” May told the story of Rudolph, a young reindeer who was teased by the other deer because of his large, glowing, red nose. It’s a neighbor, who smiles and hands the child a box before leaving. 
      Santa will politely encourage "Naughty" children to be good in time for Christmas, or reinforce good behavior in "Nice" children - all over the phone!.

      The Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony did not observe Christmas, with Governor John Winthrop even attempting to suppress it.[4] One author writes, "The Puritans showed their disdain for this pagan festival by planning hard work for the day and passing a law forbidding the celebration of Christmas."[5] By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, however, Christmas celebrations had become very popular and reflected the expanding commerce that America became known for following the Industrial Revolution. Giving gifts then is more for traditional values than the actual gift-giving celebration.
