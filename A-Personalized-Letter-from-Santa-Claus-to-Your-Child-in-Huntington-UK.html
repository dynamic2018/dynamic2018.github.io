Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!A letter from Santa Claus December 5, 2007 – 7:23 pm I have a daughter who is a solid 6 years old.  She’s very loving and polite and her belief in things her parents tell her is whole-hearted.  So when mommy and daddy tell her that Santa is going to bring her presents on Christmas, she knows that he will.  Well, now Santa writes letters and my daughter is going to receive one.
