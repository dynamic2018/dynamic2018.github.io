      A painting by Friis Nybo A painting by Friis Nybo Palace of Saint Nicholas in the Moon Christmas Morning My Dear Susy Clemens, I have received and read all the letters which you and your little sister have written me . . . . During most of his 29 years at Clear, Collins worked the graveyard shift to ensure breakfast for the contractors, military personnel and visitors who ate there would be ready in the morning. 
      He then shows his in-laws the truth about his workshop, where despite Jack's sabotage, gifts are being manufactured and will be ready on-time for Scott's deliveries. This is why the elves and I have made something special just for you! 
      But I must not see anybody and I must not speak to anybody but you. Anyway, if you do not believe in magic, then there will not be any sense. 
      His former wife, Laura, is now married to psychiatrist Neil Miller. I will be foremost in the highest circles in the capital, and make powerful friends with whom I can shape my future instead of letting it come as it will....

      The Original Letter from Santa has been a Christmas tradition since 1952, and millions of letters have been mailed to children across the globe, to nearly every country in the world. North Pole,NY, USA Santa has had a place in a small hamlet in the Adirondack mountains since the 1940's.  I don't know if it's changed much.  But, I think he likes it there because he likes white Christmases.  And North Pole, NY is one of the best places in the U. 
      Cast Tim Allen as Santa Claus / Scott Calvin Martin Short as Jack Frost Elizabeth Mitchell as Mrs. The 1947 film, Miracle on 34th Street tells the story of what takes place in New York City following Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, as people are left wondering whether or not a department store Santa might be the real thing.

      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? Research other Santa letter services to find out what the going rate is for a Santa letter, and keep your pricing competitive based on that information.
