      Rudolph and Friends Were Created in Japan YouTube Japan has long been known for its love of animation (anime anyone?). As for this Christmas, I have already gone over budget and have only bought for a few people.  This year I bought for myself too (Lego time!).  Last year I bought myself the Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi.  For this year I was going to buy myself a higher end camera but instead settled on buying myself a lot of Lego train items (beware, Lego is suppose to be doing away with the 9 volt Lego trains).

      Some websites, such as Santa's page on Microsoft's Windows Live Spaces, however have used or still use "bots" to compose and send email replies, with occasional unfortunate results.[82][83] In addition to providing holiday-themed entertainment, "Santa tracking" websites raise interest in space technology and exploration, serve to educate children in geography.[85] and encourage them to take an interest in science.[86][87] Criticism Calvinist and Puritan opposition Santa Claus has partial Christian roots in Saint Nicholas, particularly in the high church denominations that practice the veneration of him, in addition to other saints.

      Many other cultures that still look to Santa Claus as an actual saint still include this devil or imagine Santa Claus as doing battle with the devil on Christmas Eve, leading to even more strange reactions from foreigners who wonder what Satan himself is doing in, say, a children's Christmas film. Once you've found a template that you're happy with, choose your paper size (letter will work best in most instances) and border style for the paper that the letter is printed on.

      How to Create a Letter From Santa at Free Santa Letters There are quite a few websites out there that you can use to create a letter from Santa, but my favorite one that I come back to year after year is Free Santa Letters.In the 1850s, Fanny Longfellow (wife of the poet Henry Wadsworth) wrote her three children letters each Christmas that commented on their behavior over the previous year and how they could improve it. “[Y]ou have picked up some naughty words which I hope you will throw away as you would sour or bitter fruit,” Santa explained in an 1853 letter. “Try to stop to think before you use any, and remember if no one else hears you God is always near.” In an era before childhood was celebrated as a distinct period of a person’s life, gratifying kids’ imaginations was less important than teaching them manners that would speed them toward adulthood. 
      For the letter itself, you can print a beautiful base with pictures, patterns, or buy a special A4 paper in the store. And you can not send a letter in the truest sense of the word, but just write it and put it under the Christmas tree.

In the United States and Canada, children traditionally leave Santa a glass of milk and a plate of cookies; in Britain and Australia, he is sometimes given sherry or beer, and mince pies instead.

      In Finland these spirits of darkness wore goat skins and horns. BUT there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer, which only Santa has ever seen. 
      Santa is much more organic, integral, connected to the past, and therefore connected to the future. —  TV producer Jonathan Meath who portrays Santa, 2011[45] Many television commercials, comic strips and other media depict this as a sort of humorous business, with Santa's elves acting as a sometimes mischievously disgruntled workforce, cracking jokes and pulling pranks on their boss.
