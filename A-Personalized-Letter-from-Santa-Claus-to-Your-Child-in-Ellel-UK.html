Thus Thomas Nast, a very real and now historical newspaper artist, was the VERY FIRST PERSON to paint the first definitive portrait of our present day Santa Claus in 1870.Once the Yule season rolls around, you can't shake a sprig of mistletoe without seeing images of a chubby man in a red suit. 
      That means I'll be stopping by your house on Christmas Eve! Individuals can volunteer to answer a Santa letter (or several), then it is up to that donor to buy the requested gift and bring it to the post office to send to the child.
