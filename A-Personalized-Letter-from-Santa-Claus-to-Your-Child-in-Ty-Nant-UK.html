      Click on the Santa picture on the right and than follow through and send a letter to some kid that you know.  Your own kid.  A niece.  Nephew.  Neighbor.  Some kid or adult even.  This is a chance to send something unique that will continue the beliefs and happiness of the season. Much of Santa Claus's mythos was not set in stone at the time, leaving Baum to give his "Neclaus" (Necile's Little One) a wide variety of immortal support, a home in the Laughing Valley of Hohaho, and ten reindeer—who could not fly, but leapt in enormous, flight-like bounds. 
      Then when I say “Good bye and a merry Christmas to my little Susie Clemens,” you must say “Good bye, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much and please tell that little Snow Flake I will look at her star tonight and she must look down here—I will be right in the west bay window; and every fine night I will look at her star and say, ‘I know somebody up there and likeher, too.'” Then you must go down into the library and make George close all the doors that open into the main hall, and everybody must keep still for a little while. Parents are asked to complete the "North Pole Postmark," and the Letters from Santa Program responds to the youngsters. 
      After getting your business information and templates for personalized letters from Santa Claus, you'll need to decide you how want to send out your letters or cards. The Original Letter from Santa is offered in a variety of different formats, so each child will feel as special as you want them to feel. 
      It is generally an official or unofficial observance of national, religious, or cultural significance. Nicholas is still portrayed as a bearded bishop, wearing clerical robes. 
      Santa would still love to receive individual letters from your students, or one letter written together.

      The Christmas of the 20th century—festive, secular, obsessed with tradition—is an extension of this Victorian holiday, just as modern carols are an outgrowth of its 19th-century tunes. Santa lets Joe take the reins, who flies the sleigh underneath the Brooklyn Bridge much to Santa's horror, who then playfully gets his own back on Joe by having his reindeer perform the "Super Duper Looper", around the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center - an aerial trick that involves them doing a complete 360 degree turn, but Donner always fails due to acrophobia.

      The Millers built a new storefront on the new highway, slowly but surely phasing out their inventory of canned goods in favor of Christmas trinkets. "It rapidly shifted from being a general store and focused really quickly on the tourism market," explains Paul Brown, who today runs the Santa Claus House along with his wife Carissa, the Millers' granddaughter. "A lot of the military people that would come up here would want to buy something from North Pole and send it back, signed by Santa, to their families." The house, which still operates and has a staff of about 50 employees, is far and away North Pole's primary attraction and a huge boon to the local economy.

In England, a Shropshire priest later recorded 25 of these carols in popular repertoires which were sung by 'wassailers' - people who entertained in the streets by visiting houses and communally singing for a reward of gifts, or food and drink. (Originally wassailers may have sung pagan songs to drive away evil spirits, but in the Christian world, they became the forerunners of modern day carol singers.) One of the oldest songs from this time is 'The Boar's Head Carol', of 1521, traditionally sung as a boar's head was presented on the table at a Tudor Christmas feast.
