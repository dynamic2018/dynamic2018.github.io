      An example of a public and private cooperative venture is the opportunity for expatriate and local children and parents to receive postmarked mail and greeting cards from Santa during December in the Finnish Embassy in Beijing, People's Republic of China,[80] Santa Claus Village in Rovaniemi, Finland, and the People's Republic of China Postal System's Beijing International Post Office.[81][82][83][84] Parents can order a personalized "Santa letter" to be sent to their child, often with a North Pole postmark.

      Won't they be surprised!" From Carol: "We surprised our grandchildren by giving them a few clues like a number 2 and a number 7 for the 27th state of America, an orange ( fruit ) as the orange state of America, a Milky Way chocolate bar as that's where you would find Pluto ,an autograph book for all the characters at Disney and last of all a soft toy of Mickey.

Leave it there always in memory of my visit; and whenever you look at it or show it to anybody you must let it remind you to be a good little girl.
