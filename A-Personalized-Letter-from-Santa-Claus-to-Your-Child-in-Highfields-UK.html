      If you're driving on Alaska highway 2 definitely worth stopping. But it is even better than I remember it and Santa Claus was out of this world and amazing person ! 
      Even the North Pole mayor's office is decorated for Christmas year-round. But . . . there were . . . one or two small orders which I could not fill because we ran out of stock . . . . 
      Rather than the focus on the Christmas tree with a manger scene placed in some adjacent location, the focus is on the crèche itself and those persons that make up the nativity ensemble. Austria and southern Germany have The Krampus instead. 
      One of these days the elves are going to challenge that North Pole Babes in Toyland roller derby team to a match too! One thing that strikes me about the story is that they fill the pinata with oranges and lemons in addition to candy and peanuts. 
      Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time!
