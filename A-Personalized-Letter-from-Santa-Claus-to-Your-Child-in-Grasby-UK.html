      A letter to Santa is often a child's first experience of correspondence. You'll want to invest in some colorful envelopes, a stamp from the North Pole, and some nice paper for your letters. 
      He brings this up when visited by the Council of Legendary Figures consisting of Mother Nature, Father Time, Cupid, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman. Trek through the snow with warm feet in these black Santa boots. 
      There's the cold, cold North Pole at the Top of the World.  But people forget there's also the Magnetic North Pole.  Could it be that all those compasses point to Santa's Worksho... er... the Magnetic North Pole for a reason?  I'll never tell! The Original Letter from Santa is truly an heirloom that will be packed away from year to year, handed down to that special child when they have a home of their own. 
      Then you shouldnʼt be bothered by this page for a long time. Every child knows that he lives at the North Pole right? 
      Include a deadline date of December 1 in your advertisement, and let parents know the last letters will be mailed by December 8.
