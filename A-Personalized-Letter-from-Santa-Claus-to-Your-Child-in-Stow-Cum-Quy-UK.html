Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!Home » Letter Christmas » Get A Letter From Santa For Free Get A Letter From Santa For Free Friday, October 20th 2017.This can be done by telephone or on the website of the organization.
