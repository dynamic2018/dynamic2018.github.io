      The figure of Saint Nicholas was also blended with local folklore. Christian Fitzpatrick as Joe, age 10 --- a homeless boy living on the hard streets of New York who befriends Santa. 
      Nicholas was eventually named the patron saint of children and sailors (because of his concern for sailors and ships) and came to be known as Saint Nicholas.In reality, Sam has just been suffering really bad luck after losing a cursed Rabbit's Foot. 
      The fear that children might equate San(a with Jesus or God, however, missed an important point. The December issue became a Christmas staple in many American households.
