      If you simply put a letter in the mail with an envelope labeled "Santa Claus, North Pole, Alaska," it will stay within your area. On that point, Claus has a bit of a bone to pick: Santa is not the same as Kris Kringle, the traditional German gift-giver whose name comes from Christkindl, or “Chris child.” Santa Claus is derived from Sinterklaas, the Danish name for Saint Nicholas.

      What's important to monitor is whether the warming becomes part of a pattern that reduces sea ice in the Arctic, something scientists are watching closely. "Some climate models predict an ice-free Arctic at least part of the year in the coming decades," Miller said. "If you're going to have an ice-free Arctic and you're going to have big melts in the summertime but also limit ice recovery in the winter, you're going to have to have events like this happen." He continued, "If you have a lot of these events, especially with strong winds that can push that sea ice around and cause some vulnerabilities, if this is a pattern of things to come, it could really become worrisome for the stability of the Arctic." Incidentally, if you want to travel to the relative warmth of the North Pole, you may want to bring a lamp.All stories of Santa Claus and his cheery toy-making elves aside, the North Pole is a brutally cold, inhospitable place that has claimed the lives of countless explorers who attempted to venture there.
