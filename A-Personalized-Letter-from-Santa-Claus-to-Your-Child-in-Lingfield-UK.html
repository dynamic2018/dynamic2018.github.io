      Write a letter to Santa, get a response letter with. 67, but it was only one fifth as bright as our present northern pole star. 
      The best evidence we have of this comes from a letter that Twain penned for his 3 year old daughter, in which he poses as Santa Claus replying to the young girl’s Christmas list. We participate with the biblical characters in the drama on the refrain: Chantons Noël pour le Roi nouvelet! 
      The story describes the culture of the town and "las posadas" tradition, a ritual of festivities nine days before Christmas. If I should leave any snow in the hall, you must tell George to sweep it into the fireplace, for I haven't time to do such things. 
      The name Santa Claus evolved from Nick’s Dutch nickname, Sinter Klaas, a shortened form of Sint Nikolaas (Dutch for Saint Nicholas). It’s our sincere hope that whatever activity you plan, Santa’s special North Pole seeds will allow you to connect with your students and bring the class together in a fun way. 
      In addition, on the Internet, you can also find many different sites where you can leave your message for the Wizard.
