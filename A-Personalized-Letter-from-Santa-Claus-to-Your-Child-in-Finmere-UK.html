      The cookies are ready!                @Sherlock Elf: Sorry Santa, I can't watch what he's doing                @KringleClaus: Hey, why are there sugarplums dancing on my head?                @Sherlock Elf: I put that boy on the Naughty List because he was screaming.                @Sherlock Elf: Santa, that little girl you wanted me to watch is being naughty again!                @KringleClaus: The elves are having a snowball fight outside again.                @KringleClaus: The elves just told me about a little boy who wouldn't brush his teeth!                @KringleClaus: Thank you Sherlock Elf for telling me that boy isn't playing nice again.                @KringleClaus: Oh Clumsy, don't make me laugh!
