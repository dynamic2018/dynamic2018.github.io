      You will find that I made no mistakes about the things which you and the baby ordered in your own letters--I went down your chimney at midnight when you were asleep and delivered them all myself--and kissed both of you, too . . . . From mid-northern latitudes, stars track through the sky along tilted circles, Polaris is as high as an observer's latitude. 
      You can even check to see if you've made his nice list. Little clay figures, traditionally made in the south of France, are called “santons” (“little saints”). 
      December 25 is a day of more religious observance, remembering the birth of Christ. Last minute rituals for children before going to bed include aligning stockings at the mantelpiece or other place where Santa cannot fail to see them, peeking up the chimney (in homes with a fireplace), glancing out a window and scanning the heavens for Santa's sleigh, and (in homes without a fireplace) unlocking an exterior door so Santa can easily enter the house. 
      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!Got 'em. Sounds like you're ready to write a letter to Santa Claus. Once everyone’s asleep on Christmas Eve, sneak the gifts out of their hiding spot and place them carefully among the other decorations under your tree.

      5 million letters from children and we made sure they all received a reply from Santa himself – and this year’s program shows no sign of slowing down.   For Nadia Chegrinec, mother of three children, 5, 11 and 13, writing to Saint Nick has been a family tradition for a decade.   After the Santa Claus parade, with holiday music playing and hot chocolate flowing, Chegrinec and her children pull out construction paper and sit at the kitchen table to write their notes.If you would prefer your business to have a more traditional letter-type approach, and you would like to add stickers and reindeer poop to your letters instead of photos of the children, then this would be a better option for you.

      Why ALL these years people felt the need for a Saint who only did good for the good children/people, I do not know, but we still have that, don’t we . . . except the bad children are NOT punished when they WERE way back then!

      The illustrations in this story are done very well and look as if they are sketched with pencil. Much of Santa Claus's mythos was not set in stone at the time, leaving Baum to give his "Neclaus" (Necile's Little One) a wide variety of immortal support, a home in the Laughing Valley of Hohaho, and ten reindeer—who could not fly, but leapt in enormous, flight-like bounds.

      NC: (chortles and waves a hand in dismissal) Oh, we already have that, except the men suffer much more for it.
