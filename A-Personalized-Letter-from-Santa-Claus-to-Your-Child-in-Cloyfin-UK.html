      Brown, for his part, sees himself as safeguarding the legend of Santa Claus—the house refuses to have a Twitter account, for example, in case it might dilute Santa's magic. "We are very protective of the magic of Christmas and allowing kids to have that for as long as they can have it," Brown says. "Just like Santa is the embodiment of joy and goodwill, we think of ourselves as one of the embodiments of the spirit of Santa.Take this fun quiz to find out how much you really know about Jolly Old St. This is not a long term solution, as eBay fees are hefty and its always better to generate your own, free traffic, but eBay can certainly help you gain new clients.
