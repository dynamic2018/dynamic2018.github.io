      Every child knows that he lives at the North Pole right? The little girl, kindergarten age, wants to know what it is like for the ducks in the pond, so she fills the bathtub and gets in and tries quacking... and it almost makes me want to fill my tub and try quacking myself. 
      There are quite a few styles of Christmas borders here so choose the one you think your child will like the best from Santa, snowmen, gingerbread men, and globes. Alaskans as well as all Americans should not have to put up with this institutionalized level of incompetence!

Santa Claus can be spawned at other times by changing your computer's date setting December 15–31.

      The song "Fame and Fortune" is not contained on either release. The ad was created by Academy Award-winning animator Alexandre Petrov. 
      He is also the first example of the Christmas spirit we learn. His online screen-name is "MyPoleIsNorth." Santa has his own religion, called Santanism and has been accused of putting Santanicmessages in Christmas Carols. 
      Instead of “the annoyance of having to carry letters to the office,” now, as each postman brought mail directly to residents’ doors, it transformed the mail carrier into “a genuine Santa Claus [visiting] households on his beat.” As the postal system became more formalized and efficient, partly in response to the explosion of mail during the Civil War, the cost of postage began dropping in the mid-1860s. In the 1920s, Sears built several “plants” across the country.

      This week I found a copy of Mark Twain's "A Letter from Santa Claus" that he wrote in 1875 for his 3 year old daughter, Susie, to see on her pillow Christmas morning.

      If you don't know the name of the person you're writing to, you can use the following formats: Muy señor mío: (Dear sir,) Estimado señor: (Dear sir,) Muy señora mía: (Dear madam,) Estimada señora: (Dear madam,) Muy señores míos: (Dear sirs, dear sirs/madams,) Estimados señores: (Dear sirs, dear sirs/madams,) The Spanish equivalent of "to whom it may concern" is a quién corresponda (literally, to the one responsible).Children would place their boots, filled with carrots, straw, or sugar, near the chimney for Odin's flying horse to eat.

      This might seem surprising considering how the practice of Santa letters began. They weren't perfect—incandescent bulbs can get plenty hot, and sparks from malfunctioning strings can still light up a dry tree—but it was a much safer option than lighting multiple fires so close to their favorite fuel.

      Let him or her put it into an envelope addressed simply “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE.”  Later, secretly open the letter and write a response from Santa. USPS suggests writing it on the back of your child’s letter so he or she can see the original along with Santa’s response. “When responding as Santa, make the response as personal as possible by highlighting your child’s accomplishments over the past year,” USPS suggests. “For example, helping around the house, receiving good grades in a particular subject at school or participating in community service activities.” Then, put it in an envelope addressed to your child with “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE” as the return address.  Add the proper postage ― USPS suggests one of its new holiday-themed stamps ― then put it inside a larger envelope, also with the necessary postage. For the grand reveal, go with the Let the Magic Begin Welcome Show at Magic Kingdom.

      I guarantee all those who received a letter back, believe Santa is real. Too bad he never takes the elves (but I think I'd melt in Spain anyway). 
      Pagan people used to have festivities to ward off evil spirits. The most important single source for our modern day version of Santa Claus comes from the Christmas poem A Visit From St.
