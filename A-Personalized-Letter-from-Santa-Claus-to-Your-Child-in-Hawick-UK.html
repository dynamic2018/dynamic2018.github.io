      Read your kids—as much as you may be bursting to do the big reveal, if your five-year old just got home from school and is running on low blood sugar, bummed about an incident on the playground, and a bit irked that his younger sister chewed on his prized video game while he was gone…postpone your announcement. They also love the summer vacation post card from Santa. 
      Children love to receive these letters and with the templates over at Free Santa Letters, they only take a few minutes to create. Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!Home » Letter Christmas » Santa Claus Address To Send A Letter Santa Claus Address To Send A Letter Thursday, November 2nd 2017.RESEARCH WHERE TO SEND YOUR SANTA LETTER First, we must find out exactly where Santa lives. 
      Each letter also includes a jumbo sticker, proclaiming the bearer to be "on Santa's Good List; an exclusive, keepsake "Santa Dollar;" and a full-color keepsake photo of Santa. Once you've found a template that you're happy with, choose your paper size (letter will work best in most instances) and border style for the paper that the letter is printed on. 
      This allows plenty of time for parents to get their requests to you, and gives the mail plenty of time to reach the children even during the busy holiday season. Upstairs, elves usher you into a chamber and – there he is, Santa himself, with a long white beard, looking just like he does in all the pictures.
