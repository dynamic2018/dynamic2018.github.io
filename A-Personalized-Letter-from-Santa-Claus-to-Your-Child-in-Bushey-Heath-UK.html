      Nicholas or other tale about Santa Claus, watching a Santa or Christmas-related animated program on television (such as the aforementioned Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town and similar specials, such as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, among many others), and the singing of Santa Claus songs such as "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town", "Here Comes Santa Claus", and "Up on the House Top". Before the show aired, Blain hired two more "elves" to boost her staff of 10, because she knew that companies featured on Shark Tank typically receive a great response. 
      Santa's secret home was revealed in 1927 on the popular Finnish Children's Hour radio show by Uncle Markus, Markus Rautio.  Uncle Markus explained about the special mountain called Korvatunturi or Ear Mountain.  The mountain looks like a big set of rabbit ears.  Of course, the elves figured out long ago how to use the ears to listen to which children around the world were being naughty.  Drøbak,Norway Many years ago, Santa Claus built a Christmas House (Julehuset) right next to the town square in Drøbak.

"You will find that I made no mistakes about the things which you and the baby ordered in your own letters — I went down your chimney at midnight when you were asleep and delivered them all myself — and kissed both of you ... Later, she and Mab visit him to use his pool to look for some children. 
      But I had trouble with those letters which you dictated through your mother and the nurses, for I am a foreigner and cannot read English writing well. In the tale of Saint Nicholas, the saint tossed coins through a window, and, in a later version of the tale, down a chimney when he finds the window locked. 
      You can act as follows: Simply write on the envelope "Santa Claus" and throw it in the mailbox. As the young girl falls asleep, she dreams that the nutcracker doll comes to life and leads a squadron of toy soldiers against an army of mice around a Christmas tree. 
      The episode seems to imply that the only reason Santa goes up and down the chimney is because he never thought of simply using the door.
