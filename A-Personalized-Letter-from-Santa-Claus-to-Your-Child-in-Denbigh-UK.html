      Published on 19 December, the first edition sold out by Christmas Eve; by the end of 1844 thirteen editions had been released. Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time! 
      If you come across any problems or wish to ask a question, please do not hesitate to contact our Support service using the contact us form.The first sign of Christmas is the hanging Christmas wreath from the front door of the house. Sometimes the simplest things seem the hardest to write. 
      After you're done, check to see whether you made Santa's list. What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus? 
      Possibly subverted since the manual did contain a legendary martial arts technique. I will be foremost in the highest circles in the capital, and make powerful friends with whom I can shape my future instead of letting it come as it will.... 
      However, you may easily print your child’s Santa letter with the Santa’s Secret Village letterhead as a keepsake.

      Now I know he was the soccer coach, and my mother originally found his Santa Claus ad in a local newspaper "Santa Claus for hire. Ask him questions, and he shall answer them, and you carry it all on paper. 
      Let him or her put it into an envelope addressed simply “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE.”  Later, secretly open the letter and write a response from Santa. USPS suggests writing it on the back of your child’s letter so he or she can see the original along with Santa’s response. “When responding as Santa, make the response as personal as possible by highlighting your child’s accomplishments over the past year,” USPS suggests. “For example, helping around the house, receiving good grades in a particular subject at school or participating in community service activities.” Then, put it in an envelope addressed to your child with “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE” as the return address.  Add the proper postage ― USPS suggests one of its new holiday-themed stamps ― then put it inside a larger envelope, also with the necessary postage. On Christmas Eve another verse is added to the Ave Marias, telling the Virgin Mary that the desired night has come.

      You want to avoid giving your home address as a return address if you are sending letters to strangers. Dress up and bring Christmas cheer to everyone you know, or put on a unique (and warm) Halloween costume. 
      Parents want their children to be happy and to encourage the magic of Christmas as long as they can.  It’s not unusual for Santa letter businesses to charge as much as $10 per letter.  Of course, you may be able to find them cheaper online, but the quality of the letter leaves much to be desired.  Deliver great quality and command a better price. Santa Claus House is essentially a huge Christmas store. 
      But if people were playing music that they or we would consider particular to Christmas, no one bothered to say so. Too bad he never takes the elves (but I think I'd melt in Spain anyway). 
      But all the chosen people ever get for Christmas is jealous! You can also email us at info@santaclaushouse.com or fax us at 1-907-488-5601. 
      For individuals wanting to adopt a letter, please bring a valid state driver’s license or state-issued ID card.
