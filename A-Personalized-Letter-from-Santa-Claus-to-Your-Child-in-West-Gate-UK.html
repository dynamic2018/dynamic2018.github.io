      Sending the Letters to Santa Claus' Address Now that your child has written their letter to Santa, wouldn't it be fun for them to get a reply? It is said that in Eastern Europe, people used to illuminate wreaths made of evergreen leaves in winters, with the belief that it would bring spring and sunshine. 
      They are defined as areas of thin ice or open water. As we grow older, it has become uninteresting for us to write a letter to Santa Claus so that he will certainly read it and bring exactly the gift we wanted. 
      3.  Set margins, print and fill with your Santa Letter. This sort of approach grew into the norm, and a new generation of carols rose by appealing more to the Yuletide mood than to the holiday itself. 
      Even though they wont deliver to us and know it they still put the packages in the delivery truck so they are banged around and crushed under other packages all day. Here's how I did it: I got one of those huge foam boards (but a poster board would work just fine) and a package of markers. 
      An even better idea? See if the flight attendant will make the announcement overhead while you're in the air.

      But getting something tangible is becoming rarer and rarer. Once you've found a template that you're happy with, choose your paper size (letter will work best in most instances) and border style for the paper that the letter is printed on. 
      Fortunately, the Christmas magic only lasts long enough for him to get in, and then the door remains securely locked again so no one else can enter the house at night. (That Santa's one clever guy, isn't he?) If you have a home without a chimney, you'll want to be sure to get your own magic Santa key before Christmas Eve so the poor guy doesn't have to search for an unlocked window or try to squeeze through the dog door. Nicholas is known as Hagios Nikolaos, Bishop of Myra (in the present day Turkey), St Nicholas reportedly died about 350 AD.
