What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus? 
      My dear Susie Clemens: I have received and read all the letters which you and your little sister have written me by the hand of your mother and your nurses; I have also read those which you little people have written me with your own hands—for although you did not use any characters that are in grown peoples’ alphabet, you used the characters that all children in all lands on earth and in the twinkling stars use; and as all my subjects in the moon are children and use no character but that, you will easily understand that I can read your and your baby sister’s jagged and fantastic marks without any trouble at all. When you click on the templates you'll be able to see the letter template below to help you choose which one you want to give to your child.
