      Although their Christmas advertising campaigns of the 1930s and 40s were key to popularising the image, Santa can be seen in his modern form decades before Coca Cola’s illustrator Haddon Sundblom got to work. Jeannot Szwarc, however, felt that he needed an actor with more warmth than Dennehy, and toward that end, he had screen-tested such actors as David White (who, being in his late 60's, was considered too old for the role), and Moore's Arthur co-star Barney Martin.

      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? Address the envelope for Santa's letter to the child, make the return address the North Pole, put Christmas stickers on the envelope and create a postmark that will make it appear the letter came from the North Pole.

      But it takes a lot MORE magic to do it without a key, and on Christmas Even he needs every bit of Christmas spirit to make sure the reindeer and sleigh can make it all around the world.) So now, any time Santa wants to get into a home without a chimney (and even some homes WITH chimneys because it's so much easier to go through the door), he simply looks for a special key left near the door or hanging around the doorknob with a note for him. The letter comes with the printable envelope to match.
