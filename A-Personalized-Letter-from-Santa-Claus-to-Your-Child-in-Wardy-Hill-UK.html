      From the North Pole, the Dipper not only never sets, it pivots about the North Star near the very top of the sky. Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!As everyone knows, this is Santa’s busiest time of year ― and it’s tough for the big guy to answer every Christmas letter himself.  So if your kids want a letter from Santa Claus (or maybe you want one yourself!), you may have to take matters into your own hands.  The United States Postal Service has some of Santa’s helpers standing by at its Anchorage post office, ready to return letters to kids complete with a “NORTH POLE” postmark.  Here’s how it works: Have your child write a letter to Santa.

      Thomas Nast, the painter, got his inspiration from Moore's world famous poem. I've talked about it with one of my elves and he's going to search the workshop to see if he can find it for you!
