      Curiously enough the Mitre resembles and possibly derives from the headgear of old Magi (mages, Persian priests. the other Christmas present givers). On Christmas morning when we woke up there would be one big present unwrapped for each of us with our stocking sitting by it. this way we knew that Santa had left the present and filled out stockings. and it gave our parents a little longer to sleep in. cuz we'd get up and play with our unwrapped toy and empty our stockings for a while until they got up. 
      And it's getting harder and harder not just because they're older, but because they're more aware of their surroundings. 00 Buy it now Free P&P 12+ watching | 2+ sold Wonderful Festive Christmas Lantern with 8 Songs, Lights and Snow.

      Another year, the Doorman (DeMarr David), who had recently been drafted as the Avatar of Oblivion, encountered Santa and asked him for a Christmas miracle for his dad: "Some toy he'd always longed for ever since he was a kid, something to teach him the true meaning of Christmas and help forge a bond between father and son?"
