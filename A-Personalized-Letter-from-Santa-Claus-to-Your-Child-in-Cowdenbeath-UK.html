      Let him or her put it into an envelope addressed simply “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE.”  Later, secretly open the letter and write a response from Santa. USPS suggests writing it on the back of your child’s letter so he or she can see the original along with Santa’s response. “When responding as Santa, make the response as personal as possible by highlighting your child’s accomplishments over the past year,” USPS suggests. “For example, helping around the house, receiving good grades in a particular subject at school or participating in community service activities.” Then, put it in an envelope addressed to your child with “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE” as the return address.  Add the proper postage ― USPS suggests one of its new holiday-themed stamps ― then put it inside a larger envelope, also with the necessary postage.

      In the United Kingdom, Father Christmas was historically depicted wearing a green cloak.[citation needed] As Father Christmas has been increasingly merged into the image of Santa Claus, that has been changed to the more commonly known red suit.[120] One school in the seaside town of Brighton banned the use of a red suit erroneously believing it was only indicative of the Coca-Cola advertising campaign. Americans also moderated the relationship between commerce and giving by wrapping the gifts they gave.

      Even accounting for the snow wizard e-mail should not ignore those recommendations that we gave you above.It's what I have used on this website, as well as my other websites, it's what my husband is using on his website, and it is what I taught as an instructor at Austin Community College in Austin, Texas.

      The post workers in the North Pole know exactly where Santa lives, and they will be sure that letters addressed this way arrive. One year later, Henry John Gauntlett set her words to music to produce the carol we know today.
