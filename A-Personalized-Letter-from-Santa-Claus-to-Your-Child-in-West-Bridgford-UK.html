      For instance, writer Austin Cline posed the question: "Is it not possible that kids would find at least as much pleasure in knowing that parents are responsible for Christmas, not a supernatural stranger?"[124] Others, however, see no harm in the belief in Santa Claus. Whether it was a birthday card from Aunt Sue, a little love note from grandma, or even a catalog addressed to you, I'll bet the thrill and excitement of receiving that piece of mail went a long way. 
      Scott flies to the North Pole via commercial airliner and is stunned at what he sees; as the new Santa, Jack has taken the commercialization of Christmas to the extreme by transforming the North Pole into a tourist attraction where wealthy parents can pay to have their kids put on the nice list. Mexican Christmas traditions are not influenced by the American way.

      Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time!

      Things you should know about sending a Personalized 
      Letter from Santa Claus to Your Child Editable Letter From Santa Claus<br>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? This is not a long term solution, as eBay fees are hefty and its always better to generate your own, free traffic, but eBay can certainly help you gain new clients. 
      Is Santa really giving you those presents Christmas morning?

      The story that Santa Claus lives at the North Pole may also have been a Nast creation. In Italy Babbo Natale, which means Father Christmas, is Santa.
