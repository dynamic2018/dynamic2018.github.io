      Please be sure to hang your stocking and be in bed early.Quick View Official Nice List Certificate – Personalised & Hand Written Letters From Santa Claus, Making Christmas Magical Each year according to Santa Claus, in Santa Claus The Book of Secrets, a child must do more nice things than naughty in a year to earn a place on the Official Nice List and thus qualify for a visit from Santa on Christmas Eve. Once the gala is over, however, mayor Big Bit Thompson, Catone and the reporters from the Animal Examiner (who act as witnesses to the event) divide up the money between them - as they do every year - leaving only a handful of bills for the toys. 
      But I must not see anybody and I must not speak to anybody but you. Haddon Sundbloom was the first illustrator to draw Santa as the plump, jolly red-suited man we see today, which he drew for a Coca-Cola ad. 
      You could be submitting a large number of automated requests to our search engine. Mailing letters Letters to Santa must be mailed by December 4 in order to receive a reply before your school breaks for the holidays. 
      Have your child write a note and place it in an envelope addressed to Santa Claus, North Pole. Pen a response from Santa and put it in another envelope with the North Pole return address, your own address and a stamp. The reasons Christmas is popular in the United States are: retail stores make cubic tons of money; families have an excuse to get together; people can be generous in giving gifts; people will be receiving presents for just knowing someone; adults can relive being children by continuing the story and beliefs; parents can participate in the children’s fantasies of Rudolph and Santa and Elves. 
      Include a deadline date of December 1 in your advertisement, and let parents know the last letters will be mailed by December 8.
