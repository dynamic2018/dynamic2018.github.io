      Enter the world of magical dreams with Baby Hazel.

      Whether it was a birthday card from Aunt Sue, a little love note from grandma, or even a catalog addressed to you, I'll bet the thrill and excitement of receiving that piece of mail went a long way. In 1841, thousands of children visited a Philadelphia shop to see a life-size Santa Claus model. 
      Containing an authentic Elf made drawstring bag to make it look real, a 5 metre reel of Special Delivery Hand wrapped by Santas Elves cotton ribbon, 5 sheets of beautifully festive wrapping paper, as well as a selection of super special gift tags; this kit is perfect for helping you to keep the magic alive! Tell us about the events and acquaintances that have happened to you this year. 
      To avoid dependence on other nations for defense and to turn a quick buck, Santa has established The Toy Shop, a state of the art weapons-research and manufacturing facility. He often suffered for his faith and even became imprisoned and was exiled due to his strong faith in God. 
      True and utter night settles in for good on November 13. However, providing gifts would by some means be tough if we don't possess the idea what kind of reward should we give our kids-be it our truly personal kids, nieces, nephews, or godchildren.
