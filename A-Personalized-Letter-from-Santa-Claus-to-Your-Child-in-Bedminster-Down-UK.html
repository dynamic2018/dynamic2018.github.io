      Saint Nicholas was passing through when he heard the villagers talking about the girls. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      It is possible to meet Santa there, to touch his famous beard, to find out the weather forecast for the coming winter, to talk about your successes and make a wish at any day of the year (and as we have said before, for free). However, in 2006 it was discovered that Santa really created it so he could prey upon kids.

      Early reports of Santa, in his modern incarnation, were made by author Washington Irving (under the pseudonym Diedrich Knickerbocker) in his 1809 "History of New York", and by writer Clement Clarke Moore in 1923's "A Visit from Saint Nicholas" (more popularly known as "Twas the Night Before Christmas").[3] WWII In December, 1943, Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler had Santa Claus captured to destroy the U. What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus? 
      The most exciting part of this is that she will have a pinata and gets to choose her very own. Address where to write to Santa Claus: Address Russia IMPORTANT: Be sure to send an advance , so that it accurately reached in time.
