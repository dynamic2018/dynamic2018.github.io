      Promoting Santa Clause Letters Business There are two ways to promote your business: online and offline. Nick— particularly Thomas Nast’s 1871 depiction in the widely read Harper’s Weekly magazine —sorting letters from “Good Children’s Parents” and “Naughty Children’s Parents”— helped spread the idea of sending Santa mail. 
      But all the chosen people ever get for Christmas is jealous! Writing a letter to Santa is a super fun Christmas tradition. 
      Every letter from Santa is printed on custom stationery, unique to Santa Claus House - in fact, Santa has been using the same stationery with only minor changes, since 1960, continuing a tradition that adds to the letter's believability and magic. Donner and Blitzen are joined by six other reindeer and fed magic food that allows them to fly.

      When the recording was originally published, the date of copyright (published in Roman numerals) was accidentally listed as 1164 (MCLXIV), omitting an M that should have been present (1964 in Roman numerals is MCMLXIV); this mistake was not corrected with subsequent edits and remains on televised prints to this day.[26] The songs were validly and separately copyrighted, and the original character on which the special was based also remains under copyright and trademark protection, extending some indirect copyright protection to the special as a derivative work.
