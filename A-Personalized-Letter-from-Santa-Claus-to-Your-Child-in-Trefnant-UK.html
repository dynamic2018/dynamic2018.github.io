      The calypso tone was embraced by the West Indian island of Nevis in 1983 which printed the chorus on a set of Christmas stamps, (Nearby St Kitts had honoured 'Mary's Boy Child' in a similar way.) And in 2005, the popularity of the song was such that it was voted one of the nation's ten favourite carols in an opinion poll conducted by the British religious programme 'Songs of Praise'. In England, a Shropshire priest later recorded 25 of these carols in popular repertoires which were sung by 'wassailers' - people who entertained in the streets by visiting houses and communally singing for a reward of gifts, or food and drink. (Originally wassailers may have sung pagan songs to drive away evil spirits, but in the Christian world, they became the forerunners of modern day carol singers.) One of the oldest songs from this time is 'The Boar's Head Carol', of 1521, traditionally sung as a boar's head was presented on the table at a Tudor Christmas feast.
