      Or everyone could send him a spare house key, but there's no way he could put millions of keys on his key chain. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?

      He also mirrors some of our highest ideals: childhood purity and innocence, selfless giving, unfaltering love, justice, and mercy. (What child has ever received a coal for Christmas?) The problem is that, in the process, he has become burdened with some of society's greatest challenges: materialism, corporate greed, and domination by the media. I have gone through several Santa Clause letters programs and none are quite as complete as this system. 
      If children are in one home, or if there are several children from the same neighborhood, you will want each child to feel as though he's received a personalized letter. Children invariably associate the New Year with a miracle.

      It was one of the best decisions she’d ever made. “Etsy has been a wonderful experience for us,” she told the Daily Dot in an email. “There is such a sense of community and caring.  It’s like a retail family and we really are amazed at how caring the Etsy family is when crisis hits anywhere in the world.” Paulin said she has gotten nothing but heartwarming feedback on her handiwork. “I was told that one 11 year old boy was taking his letter to school to prove to his classmates Santa was real,” she said. “I’ve been told that two sisters went through their letters section by section noting the details that proved their letters were from the real Santa.” Right before Thanksgiving weekend, the seller partnered with Regretsy, an Etsy comedy website, to provide gifts for 200 needy children.
