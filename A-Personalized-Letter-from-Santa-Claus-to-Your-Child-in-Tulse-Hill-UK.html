What is Santa's address?

      By the end of the nineteenth century, this tradition of an elf bringing Christmas presents had also spread to Norway Finland, and Sweden, replacing the Yule Goat. One year later, he returns as a snowman, who has the final chance to put things right with his son, before he is gone forever. 
      A letter written on a drab white piece of paper isn’t nearly as exciting as one that is written on paper printed in shades of red and green with holiday-themed graphics.   These letters can also make excellent keepsakes. Roadside theme parks of the 1950s, it seems, no longer fascinate the way they once did. But Santa Claus has always been compelling—and while his workshop on the outskirts of Lake Placid was beginning to fade into nostalgia, two different towns—one in Alaska, the other in Finland—laid their claim to the Santa legend. 
      Santa letters are mailed during the first part of December, to ensure delivery before Christmas Day no matter where you or your special child are located.I made the mistake of bringing a post card to the North Pole Post Office so it would be stamped with a "North Pole, AK" However, it said Fairbanks.  I think you have a better chance of the North Pole stamp if you drop it off at the store here. 
      The reasons Christmas is popular in the United States are: retail stores make cubic tons of money; families have an excuse to get together; people can be generous in giving gifts; people will be receiving presents for just knowing someone; adults can relive being children by continuing the story and beliefs; parents can participate in the children’s fantasies of Rudolph and Santa and Elves. Just click on “Send Postcards” and I’ll step you through.

      But familiar as the poem is, it still leaves much to the imagination, and the 19th century saw Santa appear in different-colored clothing, in sizes from miniature to massive, and in a variety of different guises. "I have a wonderful picture of him that looks exactly like George Washington riding a broomstick," Bowler said. I understand you'd like a new _______gift name________ from me this year.
