The last two people I heard speak of it were women; neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism, 'God bless him!'"[70] The poet Thomas Hood, in his own journal, wrote that "If Christmas, with its ancient and hospitable customs, its social and charitable observances, were ever in danger of decay, this is the book that would give them a new lease."[74] The reviewer for Tait's Edinburgh Magazine—Theodore Martin, who was usually critical of Dickens's work[71]—spoke well of A Christmas Carol, noting it was "a noble book, finely felt and calculated to work much social good".[75] After Dickens' death, Margaret Oliphant deplored the turkey and plum pudding aspects of the book but admitted that in the days of its first publication it was regarded as "a new gospel" and noted that the book was unique in that it actually made people behave better.[71] The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1884, Christian Remembrancer thought the tale's old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author's sense of humour and pathos.[76] There were critics of the book. 
      Imagine the thrill your child will feel, realizing that Santa has taken a special interest in him or her.
