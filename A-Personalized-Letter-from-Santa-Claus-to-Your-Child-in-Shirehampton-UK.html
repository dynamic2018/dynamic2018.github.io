      I guarantee all those who received a letter back, believe Santa is real. The first mention of Saint Nicholas as magical gift giver in what would become the United States dates back to 1773 when the New York newspaper Rivingston’s Gazatteer makes mention of Saint Nicholas “otherwise called St. a Claus.” It’s likely that several Dutch families maintained the cult of Nicholas, but it’s impossible to say with absolute certainty.

      A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates. From 1931 to 1964, Coca-Cola advertising showed Santa delivering toys (and playing with them!), pausing to read a letter and enjoy a Coke, visiting with the children who stayed up to greet him, and raiding the refrigerators at a number of homes.
