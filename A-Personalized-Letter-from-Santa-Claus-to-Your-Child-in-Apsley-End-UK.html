      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?Towards the end of the 18th century, it reached the ear of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who used it in his Sonata No18, and almost at the same time, it was also presented in accompaniment with a 'New Years Eve' song entitled 'Nos Galan', published in Welsh in 1784 and in English in 1794 in Edward Jones's 'Musical and Poetical Relics of the Welsh Bards.' Between 1862 and 1874, the modern lyrics of 'Deck the Hall' made their first appearance in John Thomas's 'Welsh Melodies with Welsh and English Poetry'.
