      Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, Father Christmas, or simply Santa (Santy in Hiberno-English), is a legendary figure originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts to the homes of well-behaved ("good" or "nice") children on Christmas Eve (24 December) and the early morning hours of Christmas Day (25 December).[1] The modern Santa Claus grew out of traditions surrounding the historical Saint Nicholas, a fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver of Myra, the British figure of Father Christmas and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas (himself also based on Saint Nicholas). Santa Claus Drawn by Thomas Nast The famed American cartoonist Thomas Nast is generally credited as having invented the modern depiction of Santa Claus. 
      In 1939, May wrote a Christmas-themed story-poem to help bring holiday traffic into his store. You must tell George he must walk on tiptoe and not speak—otherwise he will die someday.

      There is a crocodile dubbed Gustave, who has allegedly killed around 300 people. (I personally believe 300 is a hyped number and the true number might be around 100, but yikes, that’s a lot). Lady Yunalesca in Final Fantasy X filled a role similar to this. 
      That’s where you can announce you have a surprise for her and let her follow the ribbon to the treasure. Today, many contemporary artists record holiday albums with their own personal flair, adding a bit of country or hip hop to classic Christmas carols.

      This was a fun read, if you're interested in I have always been interested in the story of Santa Claus, so when I saw this on NetGalley, I decided to give it a try. 
      It has been telecast every year since 1964, making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in history.But it is the secular version of a carol that begins, "Now the joyful bells a-ringing, All ye mountains, praise the Lord!" The pertinent question is whether either version had been translated into English in time for Wythe's 1774 sing- along—and the answer is probably not. 
      It was one of the best decisions she’d ever made. “Etsy has been a wonderful experience for us,” she told the Daily Dot in an email. “There is such a sense of community and caring.  It’s like a retail family and we really are amazed at how caring the Etsy family is when crisis hits anywhere in the world.” Paulin said she has gotten nothing but heartwarming feedback on her handiwork. “I was told that one 11 year old boy was taking his letter to school to prove to his classmates Santa was real,” she said. “I’ve been told that two sisters went through their letters section by section noting the details that proved their letters were from the real Santa.” Right before Thanksgiving weekend, the seller partnered with Regretsy, an Etsy comedy website, to provide gifts for 200 needy children. English legend explains that Father Christmas visits each home on Christmas Eve to fill children’s stockings with holiday treats. 
      On 9 September 2007 where a total of 12,965 people dressed up as Santa or Santa's helper which previously brought down the record of 3,921, which was set during the Santa Dash event in Liverpool City Centre in 2005.[5] A gathering of Santas in 2009 in Bucharest, Romania attempted to top the world record, but failed with only 3939 Santas.[5] Traditions and rituals Chimney tradition The tradition of Santa Claus entering dwellings through the chimney is shared by many European seasonal gift-givers. Some nations say it is the 3 Kings who bring the toys, while others credit Baby Jesus, since it was He who received and wants to share.

      Or is it truly because Arthur will have him silenced if he don't pretend to go along with that logic? Although Santa Claus and Father Christmas have picked up many attributes from each other, and are now basically considered the same person, they were originally distinct characters. 
      He believes in Islam (Family Guy 2010 christmas episode is proof). Skills required: This tricky Holiday Season-themed, flying action game requires very good timing skills and tactful keyboard control as you attempt to drop the gifts down the chimneys at exactly the correct moment. 
      The Tooth Fairy told me she gets “4-5 emails every week,” many of them from kids who have just lost teeth for the first time. “Often kids will send pictures or poems or adorable images along with their letters,” she said.
