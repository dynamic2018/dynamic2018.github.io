      Roger Ebert This message came to me from a reader named Peter Svensland.Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, Father Christmas, or simply Santa (Santy in Hiberno-English), is a legendary figure originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts to the homes of well-behaved ("good" or "nice") children on Christmas Eve (24 December) and the early morning hours of Christmas Day (25 December).[1] The modern Santa Claus grew out of traditions surrounding the historical Saint Nicholas, a fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver of Myra, the British figure of Father Christmas and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas (himself also based on Saint Nicholas).

In Europe (more precisely the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, and Germany) he is still portrayed as a bearded bishop in canonical robes. 
      Traditionally, Christmas trees were not brought in and decorated until Christmas Eve (24 December)[citation needed] or, in the traditions celebrating Christmas Eve rather than the first day of Christmas, 23 December, and then removed the day after Twelfth Night (5 January); to have a tree up before or after these dates was even considered bad luck,[citation needed] and that to avoid bad luck from affecting the house's residents, the tree must be left up until after the following Twelfth Night passes. 7 sample memorandum marital settlements information . free rose letterhead free printable beautiful roses . search results for amharic alphabet pdf calendar 2015 . images sin censura de ana bekoa search results .Christmas Stories » A Letter From Santa Claus Written by Mark Twain to his daughter, Susy Palace of Saint Nicholas in the Moon Christmas Morning My Dear Susy Clemens, I have received and read all the letters which you and your little sister have written me . . . .
