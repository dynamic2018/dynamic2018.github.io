      Naughty children get the Boring, but Practical gift of coal, which they can burn in the furnace for warmth over the winter; not as raw a deal as it might seem to those of us who no longer burn coal ourselves note  And lives on in the form of still giving kids who don't deserve toys practical items like tube socks. For inspiration, Sundblom turned to Clement Clark Moore's 1822 poem " A Visit From St. 
      The boys build him an awesome winter clubhouse as a gift that he takes back to the North Pole. Whenever you are naughty and someone points to that mark which your good old Santa Claus's boot made on the marble, what will you say, little sweetheart? 
      Get out a map or a globe and look up the location of the North Pole. Although Santa Claus and Father Christmas have picked up many attributes from each other, and are now basically considered the same person, they were originally distinct characters.

      For a child, or even an adult, curious about the origins of Santa, Joseph McCullough has done the research and consolidated his findings into a concise and interesting tale which covers the highlights necessary for a basic understanding of the topic. If you don't know the name of the person you're writing to, you can use the following formats: Muy señor mío: (Dear sir,) Estimado señor: (Dear sir,) Muy señora mía: (Dear madam,) Estimada señora: (Dear madam,) Muy señores míos: (Dear sirs, dear sirs/madams,) Estimados señores: (Dear sirs, dear sirs/madams,) The Spanish equivalent of "to whom it may concern" is a quién corresponda (literally, to the one responsible). 
      But I had trouble with those letters which you dictated through your mother and the nurses, for I am a foreigner and cannot read English writing well. Santa, being very conservative in terms of guessing Santa's weight, would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 lb. of force. 
      These preparing to take part ought to get there promptly at ten at the school, which is at one hundred forty St John Ave. The children who appear with Santa in Sundblom’s paintings were based on Sundblom's neighbors — two little girls.

      Frank Baum's The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus, a 1902 children's book, further popularized Santa Claus. It's not even at the Arctic Circle - it's 140 miles south of the Circle. 
      The Chicago Tribune captured this shift in the experience of receiving mail in an 1864 story, commenting that the addition of 35 deliverymen had changed the city’s whole understanding of postage. The history behind Santa Claus House and the town of North Pole is also pretty interesting. 
      And of course, every Santa letter is stamped with our trademark "Santa's Official Mail" seal and a genuine North Pole postmark. In the summer, nearby streams might attract graylings and waterfowl, but in the snow-covered month of April, it was hard to see that potential.
