      In the 1850s, Fanny Longfellow (wife of the poet Henry Wadsworth) wrote her three children letters each Christmas that commented on their behavior over the previous year and how they could improve it. “[Y]ou have picked up some naughty words which I hope you will throw away as you would sour or bitter fruit,” Santa explained in an 1853 letter. “Try to stop to think before you use any, and remember if no one else hears you God is always near.” In an era before childhood was celebrated as a distinct period of a person’s life, gratifying kids’ imaginations was less important than teaching them manners that would speed them toward adulthood. Nicolaus (Mikulás) comes on the night of 5 December and the children get their gifts the next morning. 
      A Santa Letter is not only for children; why not send one to a grown up and put a smile on their face too! They're anxiously wondering if they've been overly naughty or sufficiently nice, and eagerly daydreaming about their potential gift hauls.

      A well written letter shows you are polite plus . In 1841, thousands of children visited a Philadelphia shop to see a life-size Santa Claus model. 
      It started off as a spot to grab necessities (think: a grocery store and post office combo).Well, let's see.  Right now, he's at the North Pole.  Mind you, he does move around a lot.  But, yes, I think his address is always The North Pole! 
      For each this wizard is special and one presents it differently. New Zealander, British, Australian, Irish, Canadian, and American children also leave a carrot for Santa's reindeer, and were traditionally told that if they are not good all year round, that they will receive a lump of coal in their stockings, although this practice is now considered archaic. 
      Santa Has Been Featured in Coke Ads Since the 1920s The Coca-Cola Company began its Christmas advertising in the 1920s with shopping-related ads in magazines like The Saturday Evening Post. It begins playing in slow-motion when the bell breaks loose from the reindeer harness and ends when the Hero Boy retrieves it.You better watch out You better not cry Better not pout I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town He's making a list And checking it twice Gonna find out Who's naughty and nice Santa Claus is coming to town He sees you when you're sleeping He knows when you're awake He knows if you've been bad or good So be good for goodness sake!FANDOM Advertisement History Origins The history of Santa Claus is wrapped in legend and possibly originates from a number of different beings.

Matthew Henson, a veteran Arctic explorer, asked Peary. "I do not suppose we can swear that we are exactly at the Pole," Peary replied, according to Henson. "Peary would allow nothing belonging to you on board," Harry Whitney, an American sportsman on an Arctic hunting trip, wired Cook. 
      And who knows, maybe someday they'll match the color temperature of good-ol' tungsten lighting.First in 1932 then again in 1945, Jimmy leaves Santa a note and a Coke. 
      You can personalize a free Santa video or call from Santa to be sent to your child. Or, tell him you’re learning a new language together—and teach them how to say “We’re going to Disney World!” Avoid the flop: If you’re too impatient, this one is risky.

      Demographics The United States Census Bureau did not report any separate figures for North Pole in 2000, instead treating it as part of a larger area including Lake Placid, NY.In addition to the letter from Santa, the House sells genuine deeds to one square inch of North Pole property, allowing children to feel they have a “toehold in the far north.” Deeds arrive with the same genuine North Pole postmark, the official seal of Santa Claus, a photograph of Santa himself, and Santa’s “good list” sticker.
