      Whenever you are naughty and someone points to that mark which your good old Santa Claus's boot made on the marble, what will you say, little sweetheart? It came in every flavor—resonant coos, high-pitched cheeps, and alien notes that seemed to come from otherworldly instruments. 
      Let him or her put it into an envelope addressed simply “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE.”  Later, secretly open the letter and write a response from Santa. USPS suggests writing it on the back of your child’s letter so he or she can see the original along with Santa’s response. “When responding as Santa, make the response as personal as possible by highlighting your child’s accomplishments over the past year,” USPS suggests. “For example, helping around the house, receiving good grades in a particular subject at school or participating in community service activities.” Then, put it in an envelope addressed to your child with “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE” as the return address.  Add the proper postage ― USPS suggests one of its new holiday-themed stamps ― then put it inside a larger envelope, also with the necessary postage. There is one small reindeer farm right behind the head office of Santa Claus.

      The change in Dickens's circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, described as a "deep personal and social outrage", which heavily influenced his works.[1] At the end of December 1842 Dickens began publishing his novel Martin Chuzzlewit as a monthly serial;[n 1] although the novel was his favourite work, sales had been disappointing and he faced financial difficulties.[2] By this time he was a well-established author, having written six major works,[n 2] as well as several short stories, novellas and other works.[3] Celebrating the Christmas season had been growing in popularity through the Victorian era.[4] Although the Christmas tree had been introduced in Britain during the 18th century, its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and their practice was copied in many homes across the country.[5] In the early 19th century there had been a revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. Christmas became an important time for families to celebrate at home.

      In Scandinavia, a jolly elf named Jultomten was thought to deliver gifts in a sleigh drawn by goats. This stilla maris was later misread as stella maris; the misreading is also found in the manuscript tradition of Isidore's Etymologiae (7th century);[3] it probably arises in the Carolingian era; a late 9th-century manuscript of Jerome's text still has stilla, not stella,[4] but Paschasius Radbertus, also writing in the 9th century, makes an explicit reference to the "Star of the Sea" metaphor, saying that Mary is the "Star of the Sea" to be followed on the way to Christ, "lest we capsize amid the storm-tossed waves of the sea."[5] The name stella polaris was coined in the Renaissance, even though at that time it was well recognized that it was several degrees away from the celestial pole; Gemma Frisius in the year 1547 determined this distance as 3°7'.[6] An explicit identification of Mary as stella maris with the North Star (Polaris) becomes evident in the title Cynosura seu Mariana Stella Polaris (i.e. "Cynosure, or the Marian Polar Star"), a collection of Marian poetry published by Nicolaus Lucensis (Niccolo Barsotti de Lucca) in 1655.
