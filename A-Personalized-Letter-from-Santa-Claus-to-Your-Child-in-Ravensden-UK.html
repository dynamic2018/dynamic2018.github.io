Santa Claus®, Father Christmas® and Cyber Santa® are registered trademarks of Santa Claus Inc.As everyone knows, this is Santa’s busiest time of year ― and it’s tough for the big guy to answer every Christmas letter himself.  So if your kids want a letter from Santa Claus (or maybe you want one yourself!), you may have to take matters into your own hands.  The United States Postal Service has some of Santa’s helpers standing by at its Anchorage post office, ready to return letters to kids complete with a “NORTH POLE” postmark.  Here’s how it works: Have your child write a letter to Santa. 
      Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time! But from 1959 onward, Santa plays an important part of the Christmas scene, but elves, children, pets and toys also play significant roles. (Photo Credit:  ) (17)  “When Friends Drop In” — 1961. 
      I look forward to stopping by on Christmas Eve to deliver it. Well, I'm just a grumpy elf but even I know how to do that!  Just go to this page and send your Christmas wishes to Santa Claus!  No email or home address, phone number or last name required!  Then hit the send button to get a safe, free reply fast as reindeer fly!  You can choose between a regular instant reply on your screen or one that connects you to Santa's North Pole webcam for a free video reply.  (Just don't tell him a grumpy elf sent you!) Can I email Santa Claus and get a reply? 
      I have gone through several Santa Clause letters programs and none are quite as complete as this system.

      Nicholas In the Moon Christmas Morning My Dear Susie Clemens: I have received and read all the letters which you and your little sister have written me by the hand of your mother and your nurses; I have also read those which you little people have written me with your own hands--for although you did not use any characters that are in grown peoples' alphabet, you used the characters that all children in all lands on earth and in the twinkling stars use; and as all my subjects in the moon are children and use no character but that, you will easily understand that I can read your and your baby sister's jagged and fantastic marks without any trouble at all. Then you shouldnʼt be bothered by this page for a long time.
