      I would still advise adults not to ask Santa for some things, but to stop at something intangible and ask for a meeting with a good guy, the recovery of a close relative, etc. So he hires Patch to run the place with some of his new inventions to make toys faster. (Patch’s automated manufacturing machine successfully creates a wooden tricycle; Patch laughs for joy at the success of his invention) NC (voiceover): (as Patch) I’ve invented Japan! (All the elves cheer for Patch, who approaches Santa and receives a handshake from him) NC (voiceover): (normal) So Santa supports Patch’s attempt to put quantity over quality—that’s the American way—and later, Santa comes across a little child who seems to be homeless. 
      At the parties surrounding the posadas, children will put on a blinfold and take turns to try to hit the star with a stick. The two friends buckle themselves into the incredible Patchmobile, which they have stuffed with loads and loads of the candy canes.

      His cult spread in Europe and Christmas presents were distributed on December 6th when the celebration of St. The embroidered accents on Santa’s belt give this costume a one-of-a-kind feel.
