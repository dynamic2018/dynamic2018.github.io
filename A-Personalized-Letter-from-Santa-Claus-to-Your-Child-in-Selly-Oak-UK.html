      North Pole,Alaska, USA In the 1940's, Santa set up a small place in Alaska.¬† Soon other people moved in too.¬† Because everyone loved Santa so much, they decided to call the area North Pole, Alaska. Santa lets Joe take the reins, who flies the sleigh underneath the Brooklyn Bridge much to Santa's horror, who then playfully gets his own back on Joe by having his reindeer perform the "Super Duper Looper", around the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center - an aerial trick that involves them doing a complete 360 degree turn, but Donner always fails due to acrophobia. 
      Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July (1979), a feature-length special that paired Rudolph with the song-inspired character Frosty the Snowman.
