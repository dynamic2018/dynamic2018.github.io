      And adults do a great job of duping them.[123] —  Jacqueline Wooley Woolley posited that it is perhaps "kinship with the adult world" that causes children not to be angry that they were lied to for so long.[123] However, the criticism about this deception is not that it is a simple lie, but a complicated series of very large lies.[124] Objections include that it is unethical for parents to lie to children without good cause, and that it discourages healthy skepticism in children.[124] With no greater good at the heart of the lie, some have charged that it is more about the parents than it is about the children.

What is Santa's address?
