      Waianae, HI 74 friends 5 reviews 7/24/2017 Great place to visit father Christmas and North Pole souvenirs tread very unique very nice pieces little bit pricey but also some sweet treats from Alaska good coffee and to rein deer out time. October 8, 2013 | Rating: 2/5 | Full Review… Brian Costello Common Sense Media One would expect a holiday epic with a title like Santa Claus: The Movie. 
      A letter written on a drab white piece of paper isn’t nearly as exciting as one that is written on paper printed in shades of red and green with holiday-themed graphics.   These letters can also make excellent keepsakes. The film chronicles the origins of Santa Claus, who, along with his wife Anya (Judy Cornwell), goes from being a simple working man to becoming an international icon of Christmas. 
      Whether it was a birthday card from Aunt Sue, a little love note from grandma, or even a catalog addressed to you, I'll bet the thrill and excitement of receiving that piece of mail went a long way.

      He'll write back immediately with Comic Sans and clipart, and he'll sign off with a reminder for kids to brush their teeth and do their chores. My dear Susie Clemens: I have received and read all the letters which you and your little sister have written me by the hand of your mother and your nurses; I have also read those which you little people have written me with your own hands—for although you did not use any characters that are in grown peoples’ alphabet, you used the characters that all children in all lands on earth and in the twinkling stars use; and as all my subjects in the moon are children and use no character but that, you will easily understand that I can read your and your baby sister’s jagged and fantastic marks without any trouble at all.

The town exploits its name as much as possible, with streets (Mistletoe Drive, Candy Cane Lane, not to mention a road for each of the reindeer), lakes (Christmas, Holly and Noel) and entire subdivisions (Christmas Lake Village, Holiday Village) following the theme. 
      If you start with the first lines of demanding gifts, then the symbol of the New Year is sure to be offended and will ignore such a cheeky appeal. First-magnitude Deneb will be within 5° of the North Pole in 10,000 AD.

Then you must go up to the nursery and stand on a chair or the nurse's bed and put your car to the speaking tube that leads down to the kitchen and when I whistle through it you must speak in the tube and say, "Welcome, Santa Claus!"
