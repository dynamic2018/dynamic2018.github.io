      They pipe Christmas music in, to really keep you in the spirit, and most of the shop has every kind of Christmas decor you could possibly want. But I had trouble with those letters which you dictated through your mother and the nurses, for I am a foreigner and cannot read English writing well. 
      Their only hope of saving them now is to attempt the aforementioned "Super Duper Looper". A quick survey turns up portraits of manic stress release (“Jingle Bells”), overwrought hallucination (“Do You Hear What I Hear?”), complex Freudian trauma (“I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus”), desperate midlife lechery (“Baby, It’s Cold Outside”), forced enthusiasm (“It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year”), and thinly veiled xenophobia (“Dominick the Donkey … the Italian Christmas donkey!”). 
      International orders may incur additional bank/currency exchange fees. Nine Days to Christmas is a traditional literature book that has been around for over 30 years. 
      He and his elves then launch into a parody of "If I only had a brain." "We thought we made it all, from Barbie dolls to rubber balls / But Betsy-Wetsy took a fall. / They marked her down! / She's at the mall!" After the song ends, Dorothy laments his fate, but just then a savior shows up, hooking Santa up with a fax machine and pager (yeah, it's pretty dated, though the package does also include a cellular phone with voice messaging) Santa and his operation are saved, and Dorothy and Toto are left to lament how now he'll easily be able to check up on who's naughty and who's nice.

      I maintain that Santa doesn't have the time or resources to wrap everything, plus the wrapping would get all tattered in the sleigh. North Pole, New York The holiday season is a busy time for this New York town's post office: most mail labeled "Santa Claus" or "North Pole" that's sent in the eastern United States makes its way to the North Pole Post Office, which then delivers it to Santa's Workshop. 
      Italy: ‘Buon Natale!’ Italians call Chrismas Il Natale, meaning “the birthday.” Australia In Australia, the holiday comes in the middle of summer and it’s not unusual for some parts of Australia to hit 100 degrees Farenheit on Christmas day.

      Some Christians, particularly Calvinists and Puritans, disliked the idea of Santa Claus, as well as Christmas in general, believing that the lavish celebrations were not in accordance with their faith.[105] Other nonconformist Christians condemn the materialist focus of contemporary gift giving and see Santa Claus as the symbol of that culture.[106] Condemnation of Christmas was prevalent among the 17th-century English Puritans and Dutch Calvinists who banned the holiday as either pagan or Roman Catholic.
