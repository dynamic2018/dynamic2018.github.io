      In Finnish Lapland, of course, at Santa’s Main Post Office – and right next door, you can meet Santa himself. Some believe it was written by Henry Livingston, a map maker in New York who wrote and published funny poems in his spare time. 
      Once your kid writes a letter to Santa, read it and then write a response from Saint Nicholas himself. Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time!

      In a manuscript dated 1605 a merchant in Strasbourg, Germany (at that time) wrote that at Christmas they set up fir trees in the parlors and “hang thereon roses cut out of paper of many colors, apples, wafers, spangle-gold and sugar…” Though the selling of Christmas trees is mentioned back to the mid-1500s in Strasbourg, the custom of decorating the trees may have developed from the medieval Paradise Play. One of the first artists to define Santa Claus's modern image was Thomas Nast, an American cartoonist of the 19th century.

      If this is the case, youʼll just need to enter the CAPTCHA code once, and weʼll be able to distinguish between you and the other users on your IP address. The volunteer program enlists people, businesses and charities to answer kids' letters addressed for Santa Claus and other winter characters, according to a news release. “What better way to celebrate the season than to help Santa and his elves read the thousands and thousands of letters we have on hand?” New York district manager William Schnaars said. Operation Santa in New York City alone responds to more than 500,000 letters a year.

      In a world dominated by commerce, one important ritual of grace was spending money on others. A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates.
