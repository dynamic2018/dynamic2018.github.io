      It is a software Gifmania so you can trust their quality. To write or not to write a letter to Santa Claus is a private matter of everyone, of course. 
      Children love to receive these letters and with the templates over at Free Santa Letters, they only take a few minutes to create. Depictions of Santa Claus also have a close relationship with the Russian character of Ded Moroz ("Grandfather Frost").

The USPS Santa letter answering effort started in 1912 out of the historic James Farley Post Office[7] in New York, and since 1940 has been called "Operation Santa" to ensure that letters to Santa are adopted by charitable organizations, major corporations, local businesses and individuals in order to make children's holiday dreams come true from coast to coast.[49] Those seeking a North Pole holiday postmark through the USPS, are told to send their letter from Santa or a holiday greeting card by 10 December to: North Pole Holiday Postmark, Postmaster, 4141 Postmark Dr, Anchorage, AK 99530-9998.[7] In 2006, according to the UPU's 2007 study and survey of national postal operations, France's Postal Service received the most letters for Santa Claus or "Père Noël" with 1,220,000 letters received from 126 countries.[54] France's Postal Service in 2007 specially recruited someone to answer the enormous volume of mail that was coming from Russia for Santa Claus.[49] Other interesting Santa letter processing information, according to the UPU's 2007 study and survey of national postal operations, are:[49] Countries whose national postal operators answer letters to Santa and other end-of-year holiday figures, and the number of letters received in 2006: Germany (500,000), Australia (117,000), Austria (6,000), Bulgaria (500), Canada (1,060,000), Spain (232,000), United States (no figure, as statistics are not kept centrally), Finland (750,000), France (1,220,000), Ireland (100,000), New Zealand (110,000), Portugal (255,000), Poland (3,000), Slovakia (85,000), Sweden (150,000), Switzerland (17,863), Ukraine (5,019), United Kingdom (750,000). 
      Some of the toys delivered by Santa Claus are produced in one of the ten NPI assembly lines around the world, the most well known being located at the original plant at the North Pole, with others mainly located in Asia and Latin America, but many of NPI's toys come from retail stores (most notably Toys R Us), wholesale clubs, and direct purchases from the manufacturer.
