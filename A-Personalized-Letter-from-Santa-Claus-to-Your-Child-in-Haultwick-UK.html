      Nicholas' story alive in the form of Sinterklaas, a bishop who traveled from house to house to deliver treats to children on the night of Dec. The residents celebrate the holidays with parades, fireworks and many other special activities. 
      I made the mistake of bringing a post card to the North Pole Post Office so it would be stamped with a "North Pole, AK" However, it said Fairbanks.  I think you have a better chance of the North Pole stamp if you drop it off at the store here. Some, such as NORAD Tracks Santa, the Airservices Australia Tracks Santa Project,[85][86][87] the Santa Update Project, and the MSNBC and Bing Maps Platform Tracks Santa Project[88][89] have endured. 
      Remember that Santa Claus is one, and there are many of you, so you should not retell your entire biography, starting from infancy, a few short sentences will be enough. The American colonies established by these groups reflected this view. 
      The staff were some of the friendliest and most helpful people I have ever met, the variety of items was impressive, and meeting Santa was pretty darn cool. Watts did not write or suggest any tune to sing his version of Psalm 98 to. 
      Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time!

      Well, this time of year – this time we call “Christmas” – gets very busy and kind of crazy.  Everyone just focuses on “want, want, want.”  Have you been telling your Mommy and Daddy what you want for Christmas?  It’s ok to want a few things, but I’ve seen people – grown ups and kiddos – get very selfish with all the stuff they want.  They want so many things that they forget the whole reason we even have Christmas….  Jesus – God’s son who was born a long, long, long time ago… The very first “Christmas present” ever given to the whole big world.
