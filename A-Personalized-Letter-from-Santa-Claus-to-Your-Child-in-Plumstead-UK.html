      Many have been led to believe Santa carries a list of both naughty and nice children, so that he may provide gifts to those on the nice list and not to those on the naughty list. Having a Santa set up to take pictures with children is a ritual that dates back at least to 1918.[58] The area set up for this purpose is festively decorated, usually with a large throne, and is called variously "Santa's Grotto", "Santa's Workshop" or a similar term.

When Neale wrote the English language version of the carol, he titled it 'Draw nigh, draw nigh, Emmanuel', but later modifications of the text gave us the title and verses we know today.
