      Whether you plan to promote your letters from Santa Clause online, offline, or both, you will need to have business cards. But he’ll take some pleasure in re-reading North Pole’s motto —”Where the spirit of Christmas lives year round” — and knowing that Santa Claus lives there year round too. 
      My husband writes on the name tags because they dont really recognize his writing and we use special wrapping paper. Querido Roberto: (Dear Roberto,) Querida Ana: (Dear Ana,) Queridos Juan y Lisa: (Dear Juan and Lisa,) Note that in Spanish the masculine form, queridos, is used if the recipients include people of both sexes. 
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? In the second film, Santa is injured, so the Miser Brothers are made to take over for him.

      From 1931 to 1964, Coca-Cola advertising showed Santa delivering toys (and playing with them!), pausing to read a letter and enjoy a Coke, visiting with the children who stayed up to greet him, and raiding the refrigerators at a number of homes.

      Santa: Maybe I’m…maybe I’m just an old fool. (Brandt (from “The Big Lebowski”) looks downward in grief) NC (voiceover): So we cut back to the little boy and the little girl—Okay, seriously, three years have passed in this movie; do they ever age?—and it turns out her (speaks sarcastically) step-uncle (normal) drops by to reveal his evil plan. When the Tibble Twins see her mailing the letter, they tease her, but she tells them that it's to the President of the United States, leading one of them to conclude "Oh, so he's the one who delivers all the presents." In the Doc McStuffins Christmas Episode "A Very McStuffins Christmas," the elf spends most of the episode avoiding Santa because he's worried about what he'll think of him.

      Folklore tells the story of a nobleman whose wife had died, leaving him penniless with three daughters. And his combination of this tune and Isaac Watts's words has made 'Joy to the World' one of the most familiar of all carols.
