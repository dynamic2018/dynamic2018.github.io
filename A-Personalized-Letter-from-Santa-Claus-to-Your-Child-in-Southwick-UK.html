      Many historians agree that it took the vision of Martin Luther, the German monk who played a key role in the Protestant Reformation, to illuminate the Christmas tree.

      It is unknown why he did not do so in the end, but his song "Once Upon a Long Ago" had been indeed originally composed with the movie in mind.[8] Track listing "Main Title: Every Christmas Eve 1 and Santa's Theme (Giving)" (Mancini/Bricusse) "Arrival of the Elves" (Mancini) "Making Toys" (Mancini/Bricusse)2 "Christmas Rhapsody: Deck the Halls/Joy to the World/Hark!

      Lap-sitting is also seen in this special, and in the story "Holiday Magic." In a song available only on the film's soundtrack album, "Riding in Santa's Sleigh," Caillou performs a duet with Santa in which he and Santa sing about Caillou joining him on his sleigh ride to deliver presents. And though Nast located Santa in the North Pole, the spot itself might as well have been legend: it would be nearly half a century before the first explorers would claim to have reached the geographic North Pole.
