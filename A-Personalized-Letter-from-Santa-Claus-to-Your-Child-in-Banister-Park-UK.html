      And yet it seems to me that the topic of today's article is quite relevant, because if you do not use this knowledge yourself, you can always write a letter to Santa Claus along with your children, nephews, brothers, sisters, yes - with any kids. "Julia, let's write a letter to Santa Claus. .." In the life of every adult, sooner or later there comes a time when it becomes incredibly difficult to resist life circumstances, when nothing happens, despite all the efforts, when you just have to believe inA miracle, because it seems: nothing else will save.Images of Santa Claus were further popularized through Haddon Sundblom's depiction of him for The Coca-Cola Company's Christmas advertising in the 1930s.[7][36] The popularity of the image spawned urban legends that Santa Claus was invented by The Coca-Cola Company or that Santa wears red and white because they are the colors used to promote the Coca-Cola brand.[37] Historically, Coca-Cola was not the first soft drink company to utilize the modern image of Santa Claus in its advertising—White Rock Beverages had already used a red and white Santa to sell mineral water in 1915 and then in advertisements for its ginger ale in 1923.[38][39][40] Earlier still, Santa Claus had appeared dressed in red and white and essentially in his current form on several covers of Puck magazine in the first few years of the 20th century.[41] A man dressed as Santa Claus fundraising for Volunteers of America on the sidewalk of street in Chicago, Illinois, in 1902.

      His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow; The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath; He had a broad face and a little round belly, That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.Sundblom redrew Santa Claus as a plump, cheerful man with snow-white hair and dressed him in red and white—colors that had already become associated with Santa, but which happily matched Coca-Cola's signature colors. 
      Nothing is more adorable than a young kid’s belief in things pure and fun.  That’s why Santa Claus and Christmas is so popular. Folks could leave a key under the mat, but then bad guys would know exactly where to look on Christmas Eve, and they could break in and steal all the gifts.
