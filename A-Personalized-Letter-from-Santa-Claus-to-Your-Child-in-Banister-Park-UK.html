      Pere Noel is responsible for filling the shoes of French children. But having read my kid the riot act about needing to write an old-fashioned letter (he originally asked if he could just email Santa a link to his Amazon wish list!), I'm not willing to go that route. 
      If I should leave any snow in the hall, you must tell George to sweep it into the fireplace, for I haven't time to do such things. Your mama will help you to name a nice color and then you must tell me every single thing in detail which you want the trunk to contain. 
      The post office doesn't want to deliver the mail. If you haven’t perfected this tradition just yet, Kirkland’s has you covered.

      Send a Letter to Santa Santa really loves to get letters from boys and girls. Please Santa (USA)/Father Christmas (UK), I promise to be a good (boy/girl) if you bring me these two things this year!! 
      And apparently, the “Kwanzaa Fairy” isn’t actually a real thing. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!As everyone knows, this is Santa’s busiest time of year ― and it’s tough for the big guy to answer every Christmas letter himself.  So if your kids want a letter from Santa Claus (or maybe you want one yourself!), you may have to take matters into your own hands.  The United States Postal Service has some of Santa’s helpers standing by at its Anchorage post office, ready to return letters to kids complete with a “NORTH POLE” postmark.  Here’s how it works: Have your child write a letter to Santa.
