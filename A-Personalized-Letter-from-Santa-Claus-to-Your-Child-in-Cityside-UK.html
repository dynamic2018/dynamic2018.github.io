      A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates.Let the kid actively talk about himself Santa Claus: describe your age, name, hobbies, pets, friends, tells about a family in which he lives. finished with the idea itself, goes on to describe the good deeds and deeds that were committed by a child in the past year.
