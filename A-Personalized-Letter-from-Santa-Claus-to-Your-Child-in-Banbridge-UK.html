      The white women of the town begin to question who the true characters are and where the book is in fact taking place. There is one small reindeer farm right behind the head office of Santa Claus. 
      Letters from children from all over the world come here. The felt need to demonstrate kinship ties and communal bonds more vividly helped to insure the importance of Christmas gifts.

      It is said that he gave away all of his inherited wealth and traveled the countryside helping the poor and sick. Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!Play this game practise putting the words correct order since 1914, children have had joy of receiving letters from claus for free, and tradition continues today.
