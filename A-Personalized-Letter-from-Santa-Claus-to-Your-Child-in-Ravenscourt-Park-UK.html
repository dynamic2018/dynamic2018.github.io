      Grandfather Frost and Snegurochka visit children asking them to sing or read a poem, sometimes asking if they were good, and of course giving presents. ^ Back to Top Father Christmas Generally Father Christmas is known as a bearded old man in a fur costume who appears in Yuletide and gives presents.

      5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47. He also established the tradition that Santa knows “when you’ve been bad or good.” Nast also showed Santa getting mail from children listing their yearly wants. 
      This story gives Santa a bit of The Lord of the Rings treatment, as there's plenty of strife and battles between the good fairies that raised Santa, and their enemies, a group of rock-monsters.
