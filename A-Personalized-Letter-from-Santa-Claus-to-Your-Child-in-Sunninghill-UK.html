      The letters from Santa Clause are then printed in beautiful colors, stuffed into a real envelope, stamped with a real stamp (not metered postage) and sent for you. It can be a fun and profitable way to earn real income. 
      But having read my kid the riot act about needing to write an old-fashioned letter (he originally asked if he could just email Santa a link to his Amazon wish list!), I'm not willing to go that route. Letters from Santa - SantaClausWrites.com santaclauswrites.com/?nc Amaze your child with a Santa letter personalized from Santa Claus. 
      You can do this by making your favorite cookies (or buying a premade mix), and by mixing porridge oats, glitter and a few pinches of cinnamon for the Reindeer food. My list says, "Killed Egyptian dude, buried him in sand." I read your book.

      35 From the Desk of Santa Claus Letterhead $1. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      With a little Christmas magic, Santa discovered how to turn an ordinary key into a magic key that could open the door. (Yes, I know you're wondering why he didn't just use magic to unlock the door. Because of this, I *highly* recommend that you back up your files using a method like DropBox, a flash drive, etc. in case you may need them again in the future. 
      Notes sent to Santa are an unlikely lens through which to understand the past, offering a peek into the worries, desires and quirks of the times in which they were written. He'll write back immediately with Comic Sans and clipart, and he'll sign off with a reminder for kids to brush their teeth and do their chores.
