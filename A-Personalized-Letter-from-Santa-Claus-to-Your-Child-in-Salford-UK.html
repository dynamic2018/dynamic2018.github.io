      A mural alongside the Santa Claus House in North Pole, Alaska. No matter whether you're headed to Disney World or the Disneyland Resort, we've got plenty of ideas for telling the tadpoles "We're going to Disney!" Introducing ... 'Surprise!

IMPORTANT: Santa Claus has two official postal addresses: in Russia and Finland( Santa Claus). 
      Your mama can show you that star and you will say: 'Little Snow Flake,' (for that is the child's name) 'I'm glad you got that furniture, for you need it more than I.'" But Santa Clemens says he couldn't make out some words in an adult's hand: "I took it to be "a trunk full of doll's clothes." Is that it? Handel’s “Hallelujah” chorus, which is actually about Easter, came under Yuletide jurisdiction for the same reason. 
      However, a volunteer organization in North Pole does respond to such letters. They expect their prey to taste a certain way, like fish/seal, and we do not taste like that.

      Go to the top Christmas 2000 Hustle and bustle and hurry and run looking for gifts that bring so much fun.  A visit to Santa we also must make because of our children for all of our sakes. Otherwise, no way, because otherwise the kids will be deprived of the deserved and long-awaited New Year's surprises. 
      If this is the case, youʼll just need to enter the CAPTCHA code once, and weʼll be able to distinguish between you and the other users on your IP address. If we look back to the ancient Celts of Europe, Christmas was celebrated in those times as something known as the Winter Solstice. 
      But in the letter which you dictated there were some words which I could not make out for certain, and one or two small orders which I could not fill because we ran out of stock. Sponsored: You can buy high quality Santa Claus clip art from Dreamstime.com. 
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?
