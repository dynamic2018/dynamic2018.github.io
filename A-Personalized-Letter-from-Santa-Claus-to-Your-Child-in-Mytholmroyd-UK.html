      His cartoon, which appeared in Harper’s Weekly, depicted Santa as a rotund, cheerful man with a full, white beard, holding a sack laden with toys for lucky children. Nov 22, 2015 19:29:00    # kittykatzmom   If you have a special little one you can have a letter sent from Santa at Santa Claus, Indiana. 
      And   with   our   new   Santa   Letter   Designer,   you'll   be   able   to   edit   the   entire   letter   from   Santa,   making   it   just   right!   It's   simple, secure, and easy. Kids who haven’t experienced Disney before might not “get” the big deal. 
      So at here i would like to thanks to Santa Claus so much. Don’t worry if our stickers are a different size, shape or quantity per sheet to our competitors, we’re not looking for an exact match! 
      A sailor who fell overboard was reputedly saved by Nicholas when the saint walked on water, retrieved the sailor and carried him back to the ship. Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!One of my favorite Christmas freebies is free letters from Santa. 
      This program avoids fundraising by simply facilitating donations of willing donors.
