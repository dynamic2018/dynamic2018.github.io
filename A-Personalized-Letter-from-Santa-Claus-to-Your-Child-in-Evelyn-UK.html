Postmarked North Pole letters: To get a letter back postmarked from the North Pole, follow these steps outlined on the USPS website: Place Santa’s letter into an envelope to your child at your home address. 
      In advance of her trip, officials built a cabin a few miles north of the city, right on the arctic circle. Let him or her put it into an envelope addressed simply “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE.”  Later, secretly open the letter and write a response from Santa. USPS suggests writing it on the back of your child’s letter so he or she can see the original along with Santa’s response. “When responding as Santa, make the response as personal as possible by highlighting your child’s accomplishments over the past year,” USPS suggests. “For example, helping around the house, receiving good grades in a particular subject at school or participating in community service activities.” Then, put it in an envelope addressed to your child with “SANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE” as the return address.  Add the proper postage ― USPS suggests one of its new holiday-themed stamps ― then put it inside a larger envelope, also with the necessary postage. 
      Ask Santa to implement all his plans, health, luck, and perhaps some gifts.
