Generally, natural tree growers contend that artificial trees are more environmentally harmful than their natural counterparts.[100] However, trade groups such as the American Christmas Tree Association, continue to refute that artificial trees are more harmful to the environment, and maintain that the PVC used in Christmas trees has excellent recyclable properties.[102] Christmas tree recycling point ( point recyclage de sapins) in Paris, 22 January 2010 Live trees are typically grown as a crop and replanted in rotation after cutting, often providing suitable habitat for wildlife.[citation needed] Alternately, live trees can be donated to livestock farmers of such animals like goats who find that such trees uncontaminated by chemical additives are excellent fodder.[103] In some cases management of Christmas tree crops can result in poor habitat since it sometimes involves heavy input of pesticides.[104] Concerns have been raised about people cutting down old and rare conifers, such as the Keteleeria evelyniana, for Christmas trees.
