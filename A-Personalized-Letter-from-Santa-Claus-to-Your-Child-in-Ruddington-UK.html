      Claus is mending my red suit as I had so many holes in the knees from sliding down all of those chimneys! You want to immortalize the moment, but some kids aren’t crazy about a video cam suddenly blinking in their face while they’re trying to process the news. 
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? It is an integral part of the Christmas decorations now.

      Santa's secret home was revealed in 1927 on the popular Finnish Children's Hour radio show by Uncle Markus, Markus Rautio.  Uncle Markus explained about the special mountain called Korvatunturi or Ear Mountain.  The mountain looks like a big set of rabbit ears.  Of course, the elves figured out long ago how to use the ears to listen to which children around the world were being naughty.  Drøbak,Norway Many years ago, Santa Claus built a Christmas House (Julehuset) right next to the town square in Drøbak.

      Then drop the letter in the mailbox and start baking cookies to leave for Santa! In what one observer has called our 'materials-intensive way of life', gifts often serve as 'social statement[s]'. 
      In the 1850s, Fanny Longfellow (wife of the poet Henry Wadsworth) wrote her three children letters each Christmas that commented on their behavior over the previous year and how they could improve it. “[Y]ou have picked up some naughty words which I hope you will throw away as you would sour or bitter fruit,” Santa explained in an 1853 letter. “Try to stop to think before you use any, and remember if no one else hears you God is always near.” In an era before childhood was celebrated as a distinct period of a person’s life, gratifying kids’ imaginations was less important than teaching them manners that would speed them toward adulthood.
