      It is very hard for the young girl to impatiently wait for this moment, yet towards the end, it was totally worth it – the posada and the piñata were all a success. ii. A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates.

      The gift recipient will instantly be able to tell that the present is obviously from Santa in the North Pole. What's important to monitor is whether the warming becomes part of a pattern that reduces sea ice in the Arctic, something scientists are watching closely. "Some climate models predict an ice-free Arctic at least part of the year in the coming decades," Miller said. "If you're going to have an ice-free Arctic and you're going to have big melts in the summertime but also limit ice recovery in the winter, you're going to have to have events like this happen." He continued, "If you have a lot of these events, especially with strong winds that can push that sea ice around and cause some vulnerabilities, if this is a pattern of things to come, it could really become worrisome for the stability of the Arctic." Incidentally, if you want to travel to the relative warmth of the North Pole, you may want to bring a lamp.All stories of Santa Claus and his cheery toy-making elves aside, the North Pole is a brutally cold, inhospitable place that has claimed the lives of countless explorers who attempted to venture there.
