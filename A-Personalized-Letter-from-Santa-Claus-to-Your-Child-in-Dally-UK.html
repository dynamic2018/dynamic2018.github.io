Christmas Eve, which has ever been gaily celebrated here, which has witnessed the popping of firecrackers … and the hanging up of stockings, is an occasion now of sadness and gloom. 
      There is supposedly a reindeer school program - hasn't been running either time we visited! Ideas for creating a self-made envelope: How can I decorate an envelope? 
      However, modern stories dealing with Santa give him access to a combination of magic and supertechnology; some versions even do away with the magic altogether (for example, the Christmas ep of Buzz Lightyear of Star Command has his supertech being used by the villains to commit tons of felonies).The stories of Nicholas at sea are interesting because it’s been speculated that at least some of his myth was borrowed from pagan sea-gods, most specifically the Greek Poseidon. 
      All the same, Santa still receives far more letters than e-mail through the national postal operators, proving that children still write letters.

      You may also want to invest in display advertising in your local newspaper or, if you can afford it, in a national parenting magazine. For instance, writer Austin Cline posed the question: "Is it not possible that kids would find at least as much pleasure in knowing that parents are responsible for Christmas, not a supernatural stranger?"[101] Others, however, see no harm in the belief in Santa Claus.
