      Although there are many legends about this strong Christian leader, it is uncertain what has been embellished and what is truth. My parents never gave me a Christmas present and said it was from them. 
      The traditional Advent Christmas wreath has four candles in the circle and one candle in the middle. Sure, there are more reasons.  But this is a start. 
      Their exhaustive research demonstrated that burning wax candles that were loosely secured to a dried-out tree inside your house wasn't safe. If you say it was, I shall ask you what color you want the trunk to be. 
      Satire first sent Santa down a chimney In his satiric 1809 book A History of New York, Washington Irving did away with the characterization of Santa Claus as a "lanky bishop," says Whipps. Our instant download allows you to customize a letter and envelope from Santa and print it out on your home printer in a few short minutes, start to finish.

      If you come across any problems or wish to ask a question, please do not hesitate to contact our Support service using the contact us form.Our Santa Letters have been a holiday tradition for generations. What few songs flourish elsewhere do so in private, forgoing carols’ wide exposure in favor of smaller, more selective audiences. (“Dayeinu,” the Passover song, is thought to be more than 1,000 years old, yet shoppers are unlikely to find it piping over the sound system of Forever 21 anytime soon.) Why?
