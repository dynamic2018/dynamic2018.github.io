      Twitter will use this to make your timeline better. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      Completely do not take all the work on drawing up such a letter on his shoulders. And his last name is spelled C-L-A-U-S, not C-L-A-U-S-E; the latter is part of a sentence or part of a legal contract.
