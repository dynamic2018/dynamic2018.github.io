      A Letter from Santa Claus was featured as The Short Story of the Day on Fri, Dec 02, 2016 7. A famous bad guy in the Star Wars universe, actually. 
      For many of these countries Baby Jesus,  el Niño Jesus, brings gifts for children. The Santa Claus House received international recognition and, after newspapers and magazines all over the world wrote about the new trading post, letters from kids started to pour in. 
      Like, advice on how to write a letter to Santa Claus is needed by small children, not adults.In the Netherlands and Belgium, Saint Nicolas is aided by a helper or helpers known as Zwarte Piet ("Black Peter"). 
      I also contacted Google tech support, hoping for background on this supposed Gmail Santa. This list has the addresses, post codes and ZIP codes of all the children. 
      The templates are very personalized, allowing you to fill in facts about the child such as their name, age, best friend's name, favorite food, and all kinds of other things. Anyway, Santa Claus lives at the North Pole and that's that and I'm not moving!  Besides, I like my Canadian postal code: H0H 0H0.  (HO HO HO!) Ok, ok, Santa Claus does have other places around the world.  I'll tell you about them too.  (Why do I suddenly feel a bit like his travel agent?)  He does visit them every year (kind of like having summer homes -- does he think he's Brad Pitt or something?)  But I like staying at the North Pole.  I'm nice and grumpy right here, thank you!

      You should not ask for a gift at the very beginning of the letter, for this purpose, select the time in the middle or the end of the message. Revelers sometimes wear colorful costumes during Las Posadas, as they go from door to door looking for room at the inn. 
      If you send a letter through the official website , you can specify in advance the desired gifts and they come parcel from Santa Claus on the house.I can also change font colours, and the stickers can say from / love from or your own wording. 
      Santa has also been seen on the show "making a summer run," and once shared a chimney-vator with Perry the Platypus. Curiously enough the Mitre resembles and possibly derives from the headgear of old Magi (mages, Persian priests. the other Christmas present givers).
