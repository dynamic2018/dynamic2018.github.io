      Santa Claus and Christmas at the North Pole www.northpole.com Enjoy Christmas with Santa Claus at the North Pole, an award-winning Christmas website. I would recommend this book to anyone. ...more Jan 16, 2017 Book Concierge rated it really liked it  ·  review of another edition Shelves: concierge, library, latino-literature, culture, mexico, christmas, children-s-literature, picture-book, caldecott The subtitle is: A Story of Mexico, and this picture book details the preparations and festivities surrounding las posadas, a procession and celebration of Joseph and Mary seeking shelter in Bethlehem. 
      Not until towards the end of this book does it start to talk about the Protestants coming here to the US because they wouldn’t buy into the Catholic religion and wanted to split off and have the freedom to do so, and the versions of Santa Claus (or whatever the author called Santa at that point). I just hope he doesn't outsource all the work to the Chinese elves!  They did make an amazing ice sculpture though.  I'm just grumpy I'm not good at ice sculptures.  Guess I'll just stick to making Snow Grumpies (that's what I call snow angels).

      But Sundblom wanted the dog to stand out in the holiday scene, so he painted the animal with black fur. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?
