"Care to bake me some cookies?" During a Party: "Come now, you didn't think I only celebrated on Christmas did you?"

Christmas Eve was the time when everybody was unselfish.

      Satire first sent Santa down a chimney In his satiric 1809 book A History of New York, Washington Irving did away with the characterization of Santa Claus as a "lanky bishop," says Whipps.These weapons are often wrapped in brightly colored paper and sold to terrorists, allies, and the Bush Administration, and the profits are reinvested into this local "present-making" industry.

      As of February 7, 2007; The Santa Clause 3 made $84,500,122 in the US and a worldwide gross of $110,768,122.[2] The first film made $189,833,357 worldwide at the box-office while the second film made $172,855,065.

      By the turn of the 20th century, the public and press began complaining that children’s wishes were treated with such neglect.
