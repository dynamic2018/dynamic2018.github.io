      This means you can be sure you are dealing with a reputable US corporation with a long track record that is dedicated to providing unique and innovative personalized greetings from Santa for your children and excellent customer service for you. Claus found its way into several literary publications, like the Yale Literary Magazine and Harper's Magazine. But it wasn't until Katherine Lee Bates' widely-circulated 1889 poem Goody Santa Claus on a Sleigh Ride that Santa's wife was popularized. ("Goody" is short for "Goodwife," or "Mrs.Santa Claus is a cornerstone of western culture but who is Santa Claus...really? 
      For example, we no longer offer the epost Vault Service™ and have removed some sections of the Terms of Use that applied to that service. While the book upholds the existence of Santa for younger children, the reading level and content is more suited for older children, especially since the history of Saint Nicholas includes violence and executions along with an unexplainable mysticism.

Tree worship was common among the pagan Europeans and survived their conversion to Christianity in the Scandinavian customs of decorating the house and barn with evergreens at the New Year to scare away the devil and of setting up a tree for the birds during Christmas time."[10] During the Roman mid-winter festival of Saturnalia, houses were decorated with wreaths of evergreen plants, along with other antecedent customs now associated with Christmas.[11] The modern Christmas tree is frequently traced to the symbolism of trees in pre-Christian winter rites, wherein Viking and Saxon worshiped trees.[11] The story of Saint Boniface cutting down Donar's Oak illustrates the pagan practices in 8th century among the Germans.
