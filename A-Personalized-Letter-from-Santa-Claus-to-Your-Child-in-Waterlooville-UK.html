      Plus it's fun to say that I've been to the North Pole! The name Santa Claus comes from the Dutch "Sinterklaas", which means Saint Nicholas. 
      In Winchester, Kentucky, an organization began delivering Christmas goodies like nuts, fruits, candy—as well as firecrackers and roman candles—to letter writers. Send Santa an email. If you visit aletter4santa.com, you can get an instant reply from jolly old Saint Nick. 
      Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time! In this video, Santa Claus does not have a fat suit, and his beard is longer. 
      But I had trouble with those letters which you dictated through your mother and the nurses, for I am a foreigner and cannot read English writing well. From then on, when anyone received an unexpected gift, they thanked Nicholas. 
      Then you shouldnʼt be bothered by this page for a long time.

By 1856 a northern provincial newspaper contained an advert alluding casually to them,[40] as well as reporting the accidental death of a woman whose dress caught fire as she lit the tapers on a Christmas tree.[41] They had not yet spread down the social scale though, as a report from Berlin in 1858 contrasts the situation there where "Every family has its own" with that of Britain, where Christmas trees were still the preserve of the wealthy or the "romantic".[42] Their use at public entertainments, charity bazaars and in hospitals made them increasingly familiar however, and in 1906 a charity was set up specifically to ensure even poor children in London slums 'who had never seen a Christmas tree' would enjoy one that year.[43] Anti-German sentiment after World War I briefly reduced their popularity[44] but the effect was short-lived[45] and by the mid-1920s the use of Christmas trees had spread to all classes.[46] In 1933 a restriction on the importation of foreign trees led to the 'rapid growth of a new industry' as the growing of Christmas trees within Britain became commercially viable due to the size of demand.[47] By 2013 the number of trees grown in Britain for the Christmas market was approximately 8 million[48] and their display in homes, shops and public spaces a normal part of the Christmas season.
