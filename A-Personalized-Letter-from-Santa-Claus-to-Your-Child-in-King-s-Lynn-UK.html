      Indeed, the central weakness of "Santa Claus: The Movie" is its lack of real conflict. Here's some advice on how to help the Jolly Old Elf send a Santa letter to your little one, complete with a postmark from the North Pole. 
      It might be worth checking your computer for viruses with an antivirus utility such as CureIt from «Dr. There were so many things I could not buy in the stories that were told ‘word of mouth’, such as God talking to people, (that belongs in the bible) having visions of God coming to them in their dreams where He tells them to do this or that.

      Well, if the child does not know how to do it, let him help parents. Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, Father Christmas, or simply Santa (Santy in Hiberno-English), is a legendary figure originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts to the homes of well-behaved ("good" or "nice") children on Christmas Eve (24 December) and the early morning hours of Christmas Day (25 December).[1] The modern Santa Claus grew out of traditions surrounding the historical Saint Nicholas, a fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver of Myra, the British figure of Father Christmas and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas (himself also based on Saint Nicholas). 
      Then when I say "Good-by and a merry Christmas to my little Susie Clemens," you must say "Good-by, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much and please tell that little Snow Flake I will look at her star tonight and she must look down here--I will be right in the west bay window; and every fine night I will look at her star and say, 'I know somebody up there and like her, too.'

      Santa letters are mailed during the first part of December, to ensure delivery before Christmas Day no matter where you or your special child are located. December 24th - Nochebuena, when most Mexicans attend midnight mass followed by a family meal. 
      A tradition began which continued under the name NORAD Tracks Santa when in 1958 Canada and the United States jointly created the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD).[78][79] This tracking can now be done via the Internet and NORAD's website. One day, a group of children who had seen him dressed as Santa drove by and called out, "Hello Santa Claus, are you building a house?" An idea was born. 
      Ornaments brought from stores are used more often than not. Nicholas, The Story of Santa Claus chronicles Nicholas's life, his good deeds, his death, and ultimately his miracles before tying them all together with our more familiar image of Santa Claus.
