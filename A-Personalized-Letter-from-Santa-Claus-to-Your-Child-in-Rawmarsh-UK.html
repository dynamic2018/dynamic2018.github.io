      Maybe you received a Santa letter when you were a child- their parents and grandparents from decades ago. The letter to Santa written by 8-year old Ryan Suffern on behalf of his bullied twin sister moved us all to tears and swept the nation with feelings of hope and a renewed sense of what the holidays are about.

      Then you must go up to the nursery and stand on a chair or the nurse's bed and put your car to the speaking tube that leads down to the kitchen and when I whistle through it you must speak in the tube and say, "Welcome, Santa Claus!" Then I will ask whether it was a trunk you ordered or not. Notes sent to Santa are an unlikely lens through which to understand the past, offering a peek into the worries, desires and quirks of the times in which they were written.

      He wrote that A Christmas Carol was "a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness". [70] Douglas-Fairhurst writes that the reviews of A Christmas Carol "were almost uniformly kind".[71] The reviewer from The Illustrated London News described how the story's "impressive eloquence ... its unfeigned lightness of heart—its playful and sparkling humour ... its gentle spirit of humanity" all put the reader "in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author".[72] The critic from The Athenaeum, the literary magazine, considered it a "tale to make the reader laugh and cry – to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable ... a dainty dish to set before a King."[73] William Makepeace Thackeray, writing in Fraser's Magazine, described the book as "a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness. It’s possible that remembrances of gift-givers like the Tomte led to not only Saint Nicholas/Santa being an elf but to the big-man having an elven workforce. 
      Sure, you can still have some amazing, magical experiences once it's gone, but you are fundamentally changed on the other side of that rite of passage. Be sure to let them know that Santa knows about any accomplishments during the year, such as learning to read, remembering to make their bed, being nice to their siblings, or anything else that they've done really well. 
      Make sure your in bed early this Christmas Eve because I will be at your house #address, #town on time and while your sleeping. The next morning they will find the hay and carrot replaced by a gift; often, this is a marzipan figurine. 
      If my boot should leave a stain on the marble," he has Santa write to Susie Clemens, "...Mark Twain House, Hartford CT I read this letter long before I had children, but it stayed with me and inspired me to write notes to my own children "from Santa." Of course, there is an entire industry around this concept now, and children today receive text messages and videos from Santa, not to mention the third-party communication going on with elves on shelves.
