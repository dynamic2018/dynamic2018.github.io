      Nicholas In the Moon Christmas Morning My Dear Susie Clemens: I have received and read all the letters which you and your little sister have written me by the hand of your mother and your nurses; I have also read those which you little people have written me with your own hands--for although you did not use any characters that are in grown peoples' alphabet, you used the characters that all children in all lands on earth and in the twinkling stars use; and as all my subjects in the moon are children and use no character but that, you will easily understand that I can read your and your baby sister's jagged and fantastic marks without any trouble at all. Santa needs your help to create a more personalized experience for your child this Christmas! 
      Then when I say "Good-by and a merry Christmas to my little Susy Clemens," you must say "Good-by, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much."

      How and exactly when the words of 'Veni veni Emmanuel' became united with the funeral hymn is unknown, but certainly it had happened by 1851, when John Mason Neale translated the words from Latin into English (Neale was a prolific translator of hymns and carols from many other languages into English, as well as composing some carols of his own, including 'Good King Wenceslas'.) When Neale wrote the English language version of the carol, he titled it 'Draw nigh, draw nigh, Emmanuel', but later modifications of the text gave us the title and verses we know today.
