      Nick— particularly Thomas Nast’s 1871 depiction in the widely read Harper’s Weekly magazine —sorting letters from “Good Children’s Parents” and “Naughty Children’s Parents”— helped spread the idea of sending Santa mail.

      Undo Letter from Santa‏ @asantaletter 15 Dec 2016 More being at Thanks. Once the Alaskan post office receives the envelope, the home-addressed letter is removed from inside, post marked from the North Pole, and mailed back home. 
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?

      You have two options: traditional letters mailed by you, or an automated card sending system. He had no idea what was going on when he found his toothbrush and toothpaste in the dishwasher.

      The legend is based on the tales concerning the historical figure of gift giver Saint Nicholas. In Interpretive Consumer Research, ed. by Elizabeth C. 
      Several publications covered his lighting of the first tree, which rotated as the red, white and blue lights dazzled spectators. Another legend tells the story of an unfortunate woodsman who met a mislaid and starving child on one Christmas Eve.

      It is very important that you promise Santa Claus something appropriate to the cost( literally or figuratively) of the ordered gift. BTW I am a big fan of the heavy engineer bracelet, I have a very similar one on my yellow Seiko (a loyal friend I have had for 7 years). 
      Edward Johnson’s idea was to replace the candles with a string of colored electric lights, which he did with eight bulky, pear-shaped bulbs on a single wire. Santa gifts often lose and you have to help him with the search.

      Our contacts among the elves also say that grown-ups, not just kids, are interested in Santa. The "Santa Letter" market generally relies on the internet as a medium for ordering such letters rather than retail stores. 
      These include requiring donors to present a photo ID when they pick up Santa letters, and redacting the children’s full names and addresses—assigning each letter a number and storing the delivery info in a database that only the postal employees who actually deliver the gifts can access. “It was different in every place it was done—some only had a letter-response campaign where they would send form letters out to the kids, there was no gift giving,” says Fontana. “In New York, we send only the gifts.” It’s a much more modern approach to playing Santa than Fanny Longfellow or John Gluck could have imagined. I don't know if you need to check how good I have been, I do try but sometimes it is hard to do everything mum (UK)/mom (USA) and dad tell me to do!
