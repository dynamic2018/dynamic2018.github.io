      Definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area and into that sort of thing. Well, I'm just a grumpy elf but even I know how to do that!  Just go to this page and send your Christmas wishes to Santa Claus!  No email or home address, phone number or last name required!  Then hit the send button to get a safe, free reply fast as reindeer fly!  You can choose between a regular instant reply on your screen or one that connects you to Santa's North Pole webcam for a free video reply.  (Just don't tell him a grumpy elf sent you!) Can I email Santa Claus and get a reply? 
      Your mama can show you that star and you will say: "Little Snow Flake," (for that is the child's name) "I'm glad you got that furniture, for you need it more than I." That is, you must write that, with your own hand, and Snow Flake will write you an answer. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?
