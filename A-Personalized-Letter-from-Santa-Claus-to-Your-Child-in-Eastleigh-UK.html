      A number of denominations of Christians have varying concerns about Santa Claus, which range from acceptance to denouncement.[91][92] Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science movement, wrote: "the children should not be taught that Santa Claus has aught to do with this [Christmas] pastime. The population of the world right now is 6,630,000,000 so if 27% of the worlds population is below 15 years old then Santa has had to visit 1,790,100,000 children (nearly 2 billion).
