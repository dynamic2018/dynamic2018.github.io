      If you have the time, energy and desire, you can not just write a letter to Santa Claus, but turn it into a real work of art: decorate it with drawings, appliqués, poems and other things. In the Netherlands and Belgium, Sinterklaas is famously accompanied in his work by a servant named Zwarte Piet (Black Pete), which tends to cause headaches with foreigners unfamiliar with the tradition and quite aware of the Unfortunate Implications he represents.
