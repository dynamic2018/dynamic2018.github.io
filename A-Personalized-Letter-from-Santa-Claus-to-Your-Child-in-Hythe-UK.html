      One letter in Letters to Santa comes from an adult woman asking Santa to bring her a “tall, stately, well-bred…man of wealth with a steady income,” while in another, a boy negotiates with Santa to “trade you my sister when she comes from the stork for an elf.” A number of poorer children writing at the start of the 20th century even ask for coal—seeking warmth rather than viewing it as a punishment for naughtiness. Include things like “I know you’ve been brushing your teeth more, Thomas – and I am proud of that!” or “I know your mother asks you to clean up your room a lot, so try and work on that for me this year!” It will let them know he’s always got his eyes on them and it will encourage them to truly be on their best behavior!
