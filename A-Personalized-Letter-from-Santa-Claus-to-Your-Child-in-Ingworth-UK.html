      Santa Claus is known as de Kerstman in Dutch ("the Christmas man") and Père Noël ("Father Christmas") in French. I may have bought two shirts for my cousin's kid... whom I've never met... because the shirts were too awesome to pass up. 
      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!As everyone knows, this is Santa’s busiest time of year ― and it’s tough for the big guy to answer every Christmas letter himself.  So if your kids want a letter from Santa Claus (or maybe you want one yourself!), you may have to take matters into your own hands.  The United States Postal Service has some of Santa’s helpers standing by at its Anchorage post office, ready to return letters to kids complete with a “NORTH POLE” postmark.  Here’s how it works: Have your child write a letter to Santa. For example, in Washington Irving's History of New York (1809), Sinterklaas was Americanized into "Santa Claus" (a name first used in the American press in 1773)[25] but lost his bishop's apparel, and was at first pictured as a thick-bellied Dutch sailor with a pipe in a green winter coat.

When she finds out that she might not be getting the gift she wanted, Tina the Talking Tabby, she concludes that Arthur wrote her letter "all wrong" and decides that if she wants something done right, she has to do it herself. 
      If you would prefer your business to have a more traditional letter-type approach, and you would like to add stickers and reindeer poop to your letters instead of photos of the children, then this would be a better option for you.

The picture above is from Josiah King’s The Examination and Tryal of Father Christmas (1686), published shortly after Christmas was reinstated as a holy day in England after being banned in post Civil War England as a symbol of “Catholic superstition and godless self-indulgence.” 1810 Although the east coast of America was full of Dutch settlers, it was not until the early 19th century that the figure of “Sinterklaas” would make his way properly across the Atlantic and so give birth to the Americanised Santa Claus.
