      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!)

      While it would be too negative to attribute the rise of Christmas in America solely to "capitalist greed," it "has always been more secular than sacred," and the business aspect has played a significant role in its popularity.[6] But while the marketplace has had its influence, other factors have contributed, too, such as a longing for connection to the past and genuine desire to connect with others, such as in the giving of gifts.[7] Christmas Traditions in the United States It was in the 19th century in America that many of the traditions we know today became embedded in the culture.I think for the majority of people, we’ll still like the current ‘fairy tale’ version!
