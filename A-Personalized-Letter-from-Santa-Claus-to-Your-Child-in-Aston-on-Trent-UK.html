      5 million letters from children and we made sure they all received a reply from Santa himself – and this year’s program shows no sign of slowing down.   For Nadia Chegrinec, mother of three children, 5, 11 and 13, writing to Saint Nick has been a family tradition for a decade.   After the Santa Claus parade, with holiday music playing and hot chocolate flowing, Chegrinec and her children pull out construction paper and sit at the kitchen table to write their notes.

      Getting Started with Your Santa Clause Letters Biz First off, you'll need to decide which holidays you want to offer personalized cards for. My father was so embarrassed and t old me that Santa claus was hurt by car accident, left my christmas pr esent in front of the entrance. 
      Then you must go up to the nursery and stand on a chair or the nurse's bed and put your car to the speaking tube that leads down to the kitchen and when I whistle through it you must speak in the tube and say, "Welcome, Santa Claus!" Then I will ask whether it was a trunk you ordered or not.
