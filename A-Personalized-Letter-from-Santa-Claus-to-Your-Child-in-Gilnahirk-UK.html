      Make sure to include Santa’s address, including his postal code: Santa Claus North Pole, CANADA H0H 0H0   In the coming weeks, Chegrinec will be helping more children write letters to Santa with the Canada Post Mom Squad – a group of six busy moms who are celebrating the holidays this year with Canadians, offering tips and gift ideas, as well as sharing their important family traditions, like this one.   “I feel as the kids are growing up, our traditions are waning,” she says. “And this is one I’d like to hold on to.As long as there's Christmas, children will be writing letters to Santa. The staff were some of the friendliest and most helpful people I have ever met, the variety of items was impressive, and meeting Santa was pretty darn cool. 
      All of our letters come from Santa Claus and the purchaser is not mentioned on the letter or envelope. Christkind or Kris Kringle was believed to deliver presents to well-behaved Swiss and German children. 
      It is believed to be one of the most ancient carols in this list, probably written more than 500 years ago, at a time when its exuberant tone did not go down well with church leaders who preferred more sombre devotional songs. Instead of “the annoyance of having to carry letters to the office,” now, as each postman brought mail directly to residents’ doors, it transformed the mail carrier into “a genuine Santa Claus [visiting] households on his beat.” As the postal system became more formalized and efficient, partly in response to the explosion of mail during the Civil War, the cost of postage began dropping in the mid-1860s. 
      This was because the German ornaments were all handmade, by people who often followed ancestral glass making traditions, something that showed in their creations and continued to attract Christmas celebrants all over the world. Santa letters are mailed during the first part of December, to ensure delivery before Christmas Day no matter where you or your special child are located.

      But it takes a lot MORE magic to do it without a key, and on Christmas Even he needs every bit of Christmas spirit to make sure the reindeer and sleigh can make it all around the world.) So now, any time Santa wants to get into a home without a chimney (and even some homes WITH chimneys because it's so much easier to go through the door), he simply looks for a special key left near the door or hanging around the doorknob with a note for him. If you have curious children, disguise your handwriting on the gift tags, too. 
      Each parent should tell his child beforehand where and how Santa Claus lives.
