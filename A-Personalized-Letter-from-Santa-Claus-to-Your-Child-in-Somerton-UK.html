      If you have time , you should never miss this place. Apart from the use of the word 'Christmas' there is no mention of the Biblical story at all. 
      When a development company bought the area in 1952, it decided to call it North Pole in the hopes of attracting a toy manufacturer or theme-park developer to the area. I like it for it's depiction of culture as well as having a more universal story about imagination and love that is not unlike the Velveteen Rabbit. 
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? You can buy individual letter templates, combo packs that come with a letter and Nice List certificate, or a package that contains all 6 background designs, both Nice List certificates and envelope designs.

We're leaving disappointed and will somehow smooth it over with our kids.  I hope someone in management sees this and takes some things into consideration to make this a more magical experience rather than a commercial and disappointing one. 
      You can have your customers fill out the questionnaire and email you a photo of the child.

      What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus? We need to remind our children about the gift God gave us: his son, forgiveness of sins, eternal life. 
      To write or not to write a letter to Santa Claus is a private matter of everyone, of course. A basilica was constructed the same year to store the loot and the area became a pilgrimage site for the devout. 
      For the three weeks it took to cross the North Atlantic, Cook entertained passengers and crew alike with spellbinding accounts of his expedition. We hope you will use our gift – a package of seeds from the North Pole – to develop a classroom activity that captures the spirit of the program.
