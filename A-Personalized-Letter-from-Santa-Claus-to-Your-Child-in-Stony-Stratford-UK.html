      In Finland, however, the more human figure retained the Yule Goat name. But in early America Christmas wasn't much like the modern holiday. 
      Claus has told me that you have been a very good #age year old #sex this year. 1936: ‘Me too’ Five years on, Santa is relaxing, with his shirtsleeves rolled up, revealing a hint of red underwear. 
      The one that shows that right now Santa Claus is at the North Pole.  I'll bet if you come back to this page in a few minutes he'll be somewhere else, just to make me look silly!  See, now you made a grumpy elf even grumpier! I know sometimes it seems hard to be good, but you keep on trying your very best!  Not only have the Elves been busy wrapping presents and polishing the sleigh bells, but they have also been working especially hard getting the perfect present ready for me to leave under your tree in __________ (hometown).  Since I don't have time to write to every little boy and girl on my list, please remind _________ (sibling/ friend) to be good as well!  Now don't forget to go to bed nice and early on Christmas Eve. 
      And in England, William Sandys and Davies Gilbert began collecting old Christmas music from around the country, and publishing new carols or new arrangements of existing carols including 'The First Noel.'

      Instantly phone Santa Claus and have a conversation with him regarding either a naughty or a nice child. So, you can see we're keeping busy, but we're looking forward to visiting !! 
      But what seems unlikely to change is kids’ continued eagerness to correspond with the jolly fellow, and adults’ continued enjoyment in playing him. It may sound insignificant to adult ears, but think back: To a child, knowing he or she has the approval of "the Big Guy" can do amazing things for self-esteem and confidence! 
      Your kids will get more and more excited each time the pile grows higher. Then when I say "Good-by and a merry Christmas to my little Susy Clemens," you must say "Good-by, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much." Then you must go down into the library and make George close all the doors that open into the main hall, and everybody must keep still for a little while. 
      I look forward to stopping by on Christmas Eve to deliver it.
