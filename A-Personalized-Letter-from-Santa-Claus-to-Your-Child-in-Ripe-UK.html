      Every letter from Santa is printed on custom stationery, unique to Santa Claus House - in fact, Santa has been using the same stationery with only minor changes, since 1960, continuing a tradition that adds to the letter's believability and magic. The change in Dickens's circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, described as a "deep personal and social outrage", which heavily influenced his works.[1] At the end of December 1842 Dickens began publishing his novel Martin Chuzzlewit as a monthly serial;[n 1] although the novel was his favourite work, sales had been disappointing and he faced financial difficulties.[2] By this time he was a well-established author, having written six major works,[n 2] as well as several short stories, novellas and other works.[3] Celebrating the Christmas season had been growing in popularity through the Victorian era.[4] Although the Christmas tree had been introduced in Britain during the 18th century, its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and their practice was copied in many homes across the country.[5] In the early 19th century there had been a revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years.

      All of us in my North Pole workshop have been hard at work getting ready for Christmas. Large items, like a bike or a dollhouse, might arrive unwrapped, but even those things had a bow and a tag on them. 
      The reformation stopped the belief of saints for Protestants and therefore poor Saint Nicholas couldn't visit where he was beileved. I would have traded a lot of "The Santa Clause" for just one shot of Groucho Marx explaining how there ain't no sanity clause. 
      Also, the fact that Christmas is so very much Winter's festivity must contribute.
