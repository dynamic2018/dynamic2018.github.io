      I've talked about it with one of my elves and he's going to search the workshop to see if he can find it for you! If you have the time, energy and desire, you can not just write a letter to Santa Claus, but turn it into a real work of art: decorate it with drawings, appliqués, poems and other things. 
      Address of the residence of a good magician is: 162390, Russia, Vologda region, Great Ustyug, home of Santa Claus. Still waiting for a call from the post office, I really want to know what standard they hold their contractor to and what kind of service I should expect because I have never had service like this from any other post office. 
      Be sure you advise parents before they purchase your service that this is how you will be sending the letters. If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons.

      2/10 X   With their daughter away, the Kranks decide to skip Christmas altogether until she decides to come home, causing an uproar when they have to celebrate the holiday at the last minute. For example, if it's a co-worker and you've heard them complain about the office being too cold, a scarf or fingerless gloves would be something to consider for them. 
      This was traditionally considered a lucky day to make large purchases or to get married.
