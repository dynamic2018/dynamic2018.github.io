      NAME!!, I've been checking my list and then I had my elves check it twice, and I see that you have been a good !! They did the same thing with Washington’s Birthday, which had never been a holiday before,” says Stephen Nissenbaum, author of The Battle for Christmas: A Social and Cultural History of Our Most Cherished Holiday. “Opposition to the bill focused on the Washington’s Birthday provision, presumably because it was politically easier to attack.” Finally, on June 28, 1870, toward the end of the legislative session, President Ulysses S.

      Con was the longest serving mayor of North Pole, with a 19-year streak, and Nellie, a community marriage commissioner, has married thousands of couples at the Santa Claus House.

      You will also need to decide how you are going to send out your personalized letters from Santa Claus. Note that this date may change from year to year, depending on where weekends fall and the volume of letters experienced.The   North   Pole   is   NOT   in   Alaska!   The   North   Pole   is   also   NOT   in   North   Pole,   Indiana   so   why   should   we   postmark our   letters   from   there?   If   the   North   Pole   was   in   Alaska   then   we   could   take   our   kids   there   and   disturb   Santa   all   year   long.   That   is   not the   case.   The   North   Pole   is   secluded   where   it   is   very   hard   to   disturb   Santa.   Why   would   he   put   his   workshop   in   the   middle   of   a   city in   Alaska   anyway?   The   North   Pole   is   in   the   middle   of   the   Arctic   Ocean.   In   summer   the   temperatures   are   near   0   centigrade   and there   is   light.   This   is   when   Santa   Claus   sleeps   and   rest   most   of   the   year.   He   also   likes   to   travel   the   world   so   he   may   not   even   be home   during   the   summer.   In   winter   the   temperature   is   about   -30   centigrade   and   it   is   dark.   Under   the   cover   of   this   darkness   is when   the   workshop   comes   alive   making   toys   and   begins   preparing   for   the   big   night.   It   is   often   said   that   the   Reindeer   practice   their flying under the cover of this darkness and that's why they have never been spotted flying in the daylight.

      Nuts, candles, fruits and colored papers were the commonly used items for decorations.In 1822 Clement Clarke Moore wrote "A Visit From St. 
      When Santa arrives, he warns Donner that Rudolph won't make the sleigh team because of his nose. Nicholas.” Moore’s poem, which he was initially hesitant to publish due to the frivolous nature of its subject, is largely responsible for our modern image of Santa Claus as a “right jolly old elf” with a portly figure and the supernatural ability to ascend a chimney with a mere nod of his head! 
      Ilya Salkind, from the very beginning, had wanted an American actor to portray Santa Claus because he felt that the movie focused on a primary piece of Americana in much the same way that Superman: The Movie did.
