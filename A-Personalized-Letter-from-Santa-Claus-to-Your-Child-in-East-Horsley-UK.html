      By 1935, more than 250 million Christmas tree ornaments were being imported to America. 
      2001: Animation In 2001, the artwork from Sundblom's 1963 painting was the basis for an animated TV commercial starring the Coca-Cola Santa.The film was followed by two sequels, The Santa Clause 2 (2002) and The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause (2006). 
      Spiky versions in paper or clear plastic add graphic punch, while shimmery specimens made of mercury glass, tin, or tinsel reflect light and impart shine. "Early trees were, of course, lit with candles," says Karch. "The effect of flickering light on a beveled metal ornament would have been quite beautiful."   MAKE THESE: Silver Star Ornaments Photography: Kate Mathis 3 of 16 Dresden Ornaments Highly coveted Dresden ornaments, constructed of silver- or gold-faced embossed cardboard, were made in Germany, mostly between the late 19th century and World War I.   GERMAN CHRISTMAS: These Cookies Will Get Your Holiday Spirits Up Photography: Kate Mathis 4 of 16 12-Point Star Ornament This is the oldest ornament in our story -- a pressed-lead 12-point star that dates to 1870s Germany.   MAKE THIS: German Star Ornament Photography: Kate Mathis 5 of 16 Homes for the Holiday The German-American custom of the putz -- the miniature Christmas village under the tree, typically including a manger scene -- gave rise to the tradition of trimming the tree itself with tiny replicas of cottages, churches, and shops made from handblown glass, plastic, and paper. "When it comes to cardboard cottages, the ones with little trees still attached are most sought after," says Karch.

(Note that in several countries in Europe, Sinterklaas and Santa Claus are considered two entirely different characters, each with their own elaborate holiday.) The modern figure of Santa Claus is typically depicted as a fat-bellied happy old man with a long white beard dressed in a red coat with white collar and cuffs, white-cuffed red trousers, and black leather belt and boots, who carries a bag full of toys and gifts for children. [1] He lives at the North Pole in a large workshop staffed by elves which produces toys year round, and every Christmas Eve he sets out in a flying sleigh pulled by at least eight reindeer, delivering toys and other gifts to the children and children-at-heart of the world out of the improbably large sack he carries with him, entering their houses by the chimney, filling their stockings, putting larger gifts under the tree, partaking of whatever food and drink the family left out for him (traditionally cookies and milk), then leaving how he came in. Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!One of my favorite Christmas freebies is free letters from Santa.

      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?
