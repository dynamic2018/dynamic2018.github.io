      Then you must go up to the nursery and stand on a chair or the nurse's bed and put your ear to the speaking tube that leads down to the kitchen and when I whistle through it you must speak in the tube and say, "Welcome, Santa Claus!" Then I will ask whether it was a trunk you ordered or not. A letter written on a drab white piece of paper isn’t nearly as exciting as one that is written on paper printed in shades of red and green with holiday-themed graphics.   These letters can also make excellent keepsakes. 
      It may sound insignificant to adult ears, but think back: To a child, knowing he or she has the approval of "the Big Guy" can do amazing things for self-esteem and confidence! We often lose sight of what Christmas is really about. 
      In England, a Shropshire priest later recorded 25 of these carols in popular repertoires which were sung by 'wassailers' - people who entertained in the streets by visiting houses and communally singing for a reward of gifts, or food and drink. (Originally wassailers may have sung pagan songs to drive away evil spirits, but in the Christian world, they became the forerunners of modern day carol singers.) One of the oldest songs from this time is 'The Boar's Head Carol', of 1521, traditionally sung as a boar's head was presented on the table at a Tudor Christmas feast. I'm probably going to do the same thing with my twins.  G GlksBaby @ld8569 In my childhood Christmas was more about family than Santa, Christmas Eve was always the bigger deal (Italian...the fishes) and the gifts we got from each other/parents/grandparents were always the best gifts (like a bike would be a gift from my parents).

      Santa appears in a typical Tex Avery gag in the M-G-M cartoon "Who Killed Who?" The detective approaches a door that has a sign reading "Do not open till Xmas," and he frantically tries to get the door open. All of the designs contain the same letter, but because you'll be buying the documents in Word, you can edit the text to use the template again for a different child or next year. 
      A polite answer for public for the child or for you is, "We're too old for Santa" or something like that. Let your special child experience that same thrill today. 
      Send Santa an email. If you visit aletter4santa.com, you can get an instant reply from jolly old Saint Nick. Privacy legislation prohibits the sharing of home addresses by schools.

      20, 2016, 9:50 AM 1,533 Santa is getting ready for Christmas at his office in Finland. Nicholas in a variety of facets, including his long white beard and his gray horse for nightly rides (compare Odin's horse Sleipnir) or his reindeer in North American tradition.[23] Folklorist Margaret Baker maintains that "the appearance of Santa Claus or Father Christmas, whose day is 25th of December, owes much to Odin, the old blue-hooded, cloaked, white-bearded Giftbringer of the north, who rode the midwinter sky on his eight-footed steed Sleipnir, visiting his people with gifts. […] Odin, transformed into Father Christmas, then Santa Claus, prospered with St Nicholas and the Christchild, became a leading player on the Christmas stage."[24] In Finland they still use Joulupukki or the Christmas Goat. 
      Their collaboration successfully brought the story to life. As an alternative, enlist a creative friend to pose as Mickey and break the news.

      In North American tradition (in the United States and Canada), Santa lives on the North Pole, which according to Canada Post lies within Canadian jurisdiction in postal code H0H 0H0[51] (a reference to "ho ho ho", Santa's notable saying, although postal codes starting with H are usually reserved for the island of Montreal in Québec). 
      Stores began to advertise Christmas shopping in 1820, and by the 1840s, newspapers were creating separate sections for holiday advertisements, which often featured images of the newly-popular Santa Claus.Examples of Father Christmas from before his merger with Santa Claus can be found in the Ghost of Christmas Present in A Christmas Carol by Dickens, and in the traditional plays of English Mummers. 
      In personal correspondence, the equivalent of "dear" is querido or querida (the past participle of querer), depending on the sex of the person. However, Frost's ultimate goal is to trick Santa into renouncing his position.

      Some, such as NORAD Tracks Santa, the Airservices Australia Tracks Santa Project,[85][86][87] the Santa Update Project, and the MSNBC and Bing Maps Platform Tracks Santa Project[88][89] have endured. In reaction, a new scene for subsequent rebroadcasts was produced with Santa making his first stop at the Island to pick up the toys. 
      The popularity of the image spawned urban legends that Santa Claus was in fact invented by Coca-Cola or that Santa wears red and white because they are the Coca-Cola colors.
