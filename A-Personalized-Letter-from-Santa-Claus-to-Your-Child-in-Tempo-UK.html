      An editor at the newspaper, Francis Pharcellus Church, responded by publishing, on September 21, 1897, an unsigned editorial. A Santa Clause letters business can be started inexpensively, with little more than your imagination. 
      Claus is making a lot of wonderful treats and warm drinks to ensure we are full, warm and cozy during the cold night. These were unfathomably large warehouses and distribution centers with ground-floor stores, built when Sears was primarily a mail-order company.

However this has been found to be less efficient than the use of the normal postal service, and this tradition is dying out in modern times, especially with few homes having open fires.[78] According to the Royal Mail website, Santa's address for letters from British children is: Santa/Father Christmas, Santa's Grotto, Reindeerland, XM4 5HQ [79] In Mexico and other Latin American countries, besides using the mail, sometimes children wrap their letters to a small helium balloon, releasing them into the air so Santa magically receives them.[78] In 2010, the Brazilian National Post Service, "Correios" formed partnerships with public schools and social institutions to encourage children to write letters and make use of postcodes and stamps.

Christmas is the time when Santa Claus and Puzzle Man climb into their Jeeps and drive from house to house visiting all the sleeping people of the world.
