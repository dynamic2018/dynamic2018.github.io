      Postal Service launched Letters to Santa earlier this month. However when we take an analytical approach to these lists, we find that this theory does not add up. 
      Cupid@gmail.com is out because Google requires at least six characters when creating an account. One regional distribution center typically is responsible for an area the size of Texas, and employs hundreds of elves who must process thousands or even millions of presents all in one night.

      Elves will likely not see the world or even the actual North Pole unless they stay with the company well into adulthood; many elves end up employed in their own neighborhoods.
