      Nicholas, a 4th-century Christian bishop from Lycia (now in Turkey), the figure is also strongly influenced by early Norse religion. Some Christians, particularly Calvinists and Puritans, disliked the idea of Santa Claus, as well as Christmas in general, believing that the lavish celebrations were not in accordance with their faith.[105] Other nonconformist Christians condemn the materialist focus of contemporary gift giving and see Santa Claus as the symbol of that culture.[106] Condemnation of Christmas was prevalent among the 17th-century English Puritans and Dutch Calvinists who banned the holiday as either pagan or Roman Catholic.

      George, Utah. "Our hymn tradition has adopted hymns from many different denominations," Davidson explained, "and the shared Christmas hymns are especially dear to us." Christmas hymns in the LDS hymnbook can trace back to priests and hymnists that were Catholic, Methodist, Unitarian and more.
