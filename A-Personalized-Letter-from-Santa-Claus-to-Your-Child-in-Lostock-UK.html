Children love to receive these letters and with the templates over at Free Santa Letters, they only take a few minutes to create.

What is Santa's address?

      I wrote "We're going to Disney World!!!" in big, bright letters.I just hope he doesn't outsource all the work to the Chinese elves!  They did make an amazing ice sculpture though.  I'm just grumpy I'm not good at ice sculptures.  Guess I'll just stick to making Snow Grumpies (that's what I call snow angels). 
      Can would wear the suit on his trips to interior Alaska as something of a gimmick, and became the first Santa Claus many of the village children had ever seen. All these conditions combine to create a very powerful Circumpolar Vortex. 
      But you can enliven your letter with pictures, drawings, funny jokes, and stories telling about your child's favorite games, sports, friends, pets, and other details. Rudolph’s message—that given the opportunity, a liability can be turned into an asset—proved popular.
