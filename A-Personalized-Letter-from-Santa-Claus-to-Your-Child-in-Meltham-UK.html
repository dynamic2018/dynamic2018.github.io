I did not enjoy this book, sadly, and it's a shame for your children because they won't understand this at all. 
      Be sure to let them know that Santa knows about any accomplishments during the year, such as learning to read, remembering to make their bed, being nice to their siblings, or anything else that they've done really well. Postal employees, charitable organizations, corporations, and members of the public volunteer their time and respond to children across the country.
