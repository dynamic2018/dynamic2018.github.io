      Santa's Workshop at North Pole, New York For decades, Santa's home at the North Pole lived solely in Nast's cartoons and the fantasies of children. The fear that children might equate San(a with Jesus or God, however, missed an important point. 
      The ripest Santa Claus melon will have soft blossom ends that yield to gentle pressure and a vibrant yellow hue. But he’ll take some pleasure in re-reading North Pole’s motto —”Where the spirit of Christmas lives year round” — and knowing that Santa Claus lives there year round too.
