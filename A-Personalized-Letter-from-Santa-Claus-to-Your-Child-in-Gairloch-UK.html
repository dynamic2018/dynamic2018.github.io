      It is believed that Santa Claus lives in a distant city in the north of Russia - Veliky Ustyug. There is an ice bar with strong drinks for adults there (extra fee for drinks). 
      M MLP7211 @ld8569 When I was a kid, Santa have one big gift and maybe two small ones. In Christianity, a wreath is a symbol of God's eternity as it is a circle and has neither beginning nor end. 
      The sailors spread Nicholas' story around the world, turning him into one of the most popular saints in Christendom.  When he died, Nicholas' bones remained in Myra (now Demre), the coastal city where he had served as bishop.

      Their Santa letters make the heavy mail season tolerable for me. For Santa to do his work, he must secretly slip in and out of a home. 
      From World War I (a mother wrote to Gluck’s Santa Claus Association “We had to break up our home last winter, for my husband who is a longshoreman could not get work since the war began”) to the Great Depression; from 9/11 to Superstorm Sandy (a child writing in 2012 promises to “ask for much less this year so you can focus on the kids that are less fortunate than me”). “I love the idea that we can see history through these letters,” says Thompson.

      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? But getting something tangible is becoming rarer and rarer.

      During the off season (which is any time that isn't Christmas, I think... and possibly summer?) Santa is out of the office on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so we missed him, but his Throne is still out and you can take photos of it. Some organizations let you email Santa, receive a letter from him, get a video response and check if you're on the nice list. 
      Although the specific content of the letters Santa receives is of course confidential, our elf sources tell us that subjects often range beyond the obvious holiday gift wishlists. Your kid probably knows that Santa lives at the North Pole, but where is that exactly?
