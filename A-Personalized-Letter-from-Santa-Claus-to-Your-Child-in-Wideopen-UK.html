      The famous “O Holy Night,” translated into English in the nineteenth century, is originally a French carol, Chantique de Noël. “Noël nouvelet, Noël chanton ici” (“Sing we now of Christmas”) follows well in this tradition, but brings a distinctive emphasis. For instance, writer Austin Cline posed the question: "Is it not possible that kids would find at least as much pleasure in knowing that parents are responsible for Christmas, not a supernatural stranger?"[124] Others, however, see no harm in the belief in Santa Claus.
