      The most magic part of this book is that part of the profits made from this book will go to helping disadvantaged children throughout the world. This page is part of the $10,000 Money Making Mama Challenge. 
      One letter in Letters to Santa comes from an adult woman asking Santa to bring her a “tall, stately, well-bred…man of wealth with a steady income,” while in another, a boy negotiates with Santa to “trade you my sister when she comes from the stork for an elf.” A number of poorer children writing at the start of the 20th century even ask for coal—seeking warmth rather than viewing it as a punishment for naughtiness.

      Twain was very close to his daughter, all the way up to her untimely death at age 24 in 1896, and that year she had written her first letter to Santa Claus. Where does Santa live?  Where doesn't Santa live!  It's like Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous with him!  Santa Claus has homes all around the world.  Here are some of the places he lives: Santa's main home is at The North Pole (of course, silly!) -- it's in Canada. 
      Popular culture isn't any help -- many cartoons, etc. show Santa physically leaving unwrapped toys being left under the tree or in stockings (see The Island of Lost Toys, etc.) but others (ie: A Christmas Story) clearly show children unwrapping gifts from Santa. Thereafter no one could prevent the inevitable triumph of Moore's Santa. ^ Back to Top Thomas Nast Thomas Nast, a well known and respected painter, found  inspiration for his extremely popular painting of today's Santa Claus from Clement C.

      Most probably it derives from ancient Christian writings called the 'New Testament Apocrypha' and a text known as the 'Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew', which relates the story of a later flight by Joseph, Mary and Jesus into Egypt. A cracker consists of a segmented cardboard tube wrapped in a brightly decorated twist of paper with a prize in the central chamber,[1] making it resemble an oversized sweet-wrapper. 
      Employment is by invitation only, and the "recruiters" often represent "elfhood" as a "once in a life time opportunity to gain experience, see the world, and receive and benefits that most could only dream of." They usually seek student athletes and JROTC cadets, attempting to convince ball players, cheerleaders, weightlifters, JROTC PT team members, and other students likely capable of heavy lifting to give up their school activities in favor of employment with NPI.
