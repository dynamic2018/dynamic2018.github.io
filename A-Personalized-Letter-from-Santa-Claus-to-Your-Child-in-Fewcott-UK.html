"Julia, let's write a letter to Santa Claus. .." In the life of every adult, sooner or later there comes a time when it becomes incredibly difficult to resist life circumstances, when nothing happens, despite all the efforts, when you just have to believe inA miracle, because it seems: nothing else will save. 
      If you start with the first lines of demanding gifts, then the symbol of the New Year is sure to be offended and will ignore such a cheeky appeal.
