      It shows Santa Claus on his sleigh, which has arrived at a U. His address is: Santa Claus, North Pole, Canada, H0H 0H0; no postage is required.[75] (see also: Ho ho ho). (This postal code, in which zeroes are used for the letter "O", is consistent with the alternating letter-number format of all Canadian postal codes.) Sometimes children's charities answer letters in poor communities, or from children's hospitals, and give them presents they would not otherwise receive.

Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, Father Christmas, or simply Santa (Santy in Hiberno-English), is a legendary figure originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts to the homes of well-behaved ("good" or "nice") children on Christmas Eve (24 December) and the early morning hours of Christmas Day (25 December).[1] The modern Santa Claus grew out of traditions surrounding the historical Saint Nicholas, a fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver of Myra, the British figure of Father Christmas and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas (himself also based on Saint Nicholas).

      Santa's Canadian Mailing Address For over 30 years, current and retired Canada Post employees have been volunteering their time to answer letters to Santa. My friend Ani had such a moment in her life after a series of disappointments in her personal life.

      For the maximum exposure to your letters from Santa Clause business, you will want to consider marketing both online and offline. Twitter will use this to make your timeline better.
