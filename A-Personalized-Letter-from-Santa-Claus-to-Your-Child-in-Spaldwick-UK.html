      Add A Letter from Santa Claus to your own personal library.In 1875, Mark Twain wrote a letter to his daughter Susie, who was 3 years old at the time, which he signed "Your loving Santa Claus." You can read it in its entirety below, but first a little bit of pretext. Just thinking about this place makes me smile :) My husband and I made a planned stop here during a long AK road trip this summer and I'm so glad we included it in our itinerary! 
      Nicholas in the United States, commissioned by the New-York Historical Society in 1810, showed him in ecclesiastical garb with a switch in hand next to a crying child, while the earliest known Santa picture-book shows him leaving a birch rod in a naughty child’s stocking, which he “Directs a Parent’s hand to use / When virtue’s path his sons refuse.” The earliest Santa letters are similarly didactic, usually coming from St. However, Scott has used up the last of his magic wooing Carol, and Comet has eaten too many chocolate bars.

      The change in Dickens's circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, described as a "deep personal and social outrage", which heavily influenced his works.[1] At the end of December 1842 Dickens began publishing his novel Martin Chuzzlewit as a monthly serial;[n 1] although the novel was his favourite work, sales had been disappointing and he faced financial difficulties.[2] By this time he was a well-established author, having written six major works,[n 2] as well as several short stories, novellas and other works.[3] Celebrating the Christmas season had been growing in popularity through the Victorian era.[4] Although the Christmas tree had been introduced in Britain during the 18th century, its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and their practice was copied in many homes across the country.[5] In the early 19th century there had been a revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years.Today Grandfather Frost is connected to New Year celebrations, but before 1917 he was much more related to Christmas.

      Canby quipped that "Santa's workshop must be the world's largest purchaser of low-grade plywood" and that the flyover sequences with Santa "aren't great." The only praise he had for the film's acting was for John Lithgow, who Canby wrote "(gave) the film's only remotely stylish performance."[4] A more recent review by William Mager on BBC.co.uk's review section echoed Canby and Ebert's comments.[5] Soundtrack The soundtrack was composed and conducted by Henry Mancini, composer of the themes from The Pink Panther and Peter Gunn, with veteran lyricist and screenwriter Leslie Bricusse contributing five original songs.
