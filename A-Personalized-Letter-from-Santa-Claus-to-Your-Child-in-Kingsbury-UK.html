      In the evenings, Dutch Children sing songs in front of the fire place or in the living room and leave their shoe with a present (drawing for Sinterklaas and Zwarte Piet or a Carrot for Amerigo Sinterklaas' horse) In the mornings they will find their shoe filled with candy and small presents. Santas helpers have endeavoured to ensure there is nothing here that would dimish any childs wonder of christmas. 
      Another activity could be making their own piñata in the shape they would choose if they has a posada, because art projects are always a hit in the classroom and help the students further understand the story in a crafty way. And if you weren't lucky enough to receive the Original Letter from Santa as a child, start a tradition that is sure to be appreciated, fondly remembered, and passed down to future generations. 
      Revisions apply to wording edits only; changing the design or colours of the invitation is NOT considered a revision. 00pm will be dispatched by 2nd class post in 3-4 working days.

      The population of the world right now is 6,630,000,000 so if 27% of the worlds population is below 15 years old then Santa has had to visit 1,790,100,000 children (nearly 2 billion). This is also the origin of three gold balls being used as a symbol for pawnbrokers.[1][2] A tradition that began in a European country originally, children simply used one of their everyday socks, but eventually special Christmas stockings were created for this purpose.

During their struggle, Santa Claus managed to free himself, and used his powers to restore both Ant-Man and Doctor Octopus to normal size. 
      In the United States, the most notable of these is the Santa at the flagship Macy's store in New York City—he arrives at the store by sleigh in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on the last float, and his court takes over a large portion of one floor in the store. His charity became legend when a man lost his fortune and found himself incapable of supporting his three daughters, who would not be able to find husbands as they lacked dowries.
