      Nicholas as the patron saint of New York in his book, The History of New York. But it is even better than I remember it and Santa Claus was out of this world and amazing person ! 
      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!One of my favorite Christmas freebies is free letters from Santa. But I am happy to tell you, where I work is here.

      Honestly, I thought I was getting a book that was much more classic of ‘our’ Santa Claus, and aimed more towards family, especially our children, but I was very wrong. Mistletoe has evergreen leaves and white berries. 
      Letters are available in three packages, from a simple package that includes only a letter and envelope, to the largest package that includes a letter from Santa, an envelope, a letter from Rudolph, a Nice List certificate and an autographed photo of Santa Claus.

      Parents grew more comfortable with paying for stamps, and children began to view the postman as an actual conduit to the Christmas figure. Odin commanded his son, Thor, to stay his hand against Grylak and instead gather a quantity of Asgard's finest foods, wines, and linens.
