      Santa Claus Got a New Friend in 1942 In 1942, Coca-Cola introduced "Sprite Boy," a character who appeared with Santa Claus in Coca-Cola advertising throughout the 1940s and 1950s. This celebration, referred to as Las Posadas, lasts from December 16 until Christmas Eve on December 24. 
      Santa Claus in the 1910s and 1920s had largely come into focus as the jolly, bearded, happy soul we would recognize today, but artists still occasionally tweaked the color of Santa's robes or the amount of girth they added around the middle. S. box office success of 1983's Superman III and its immediate follow-up, 1984's Supergirl, Santa Claus: The Movie was directed by Jeannot Szwarc, who had directed Supergirl, from a story by David and Leslie Newman. 
      C., and grew up on Manhattan’s East Side. His early life was not unlike any of ours: he went to school, learned to drive, began studying for a PhD but never finished his dissertation. Sometimes a photograph of the child and Santa are taken. 
      Images of Santa Claus were further popularized through a depiction of him for The Coca-Cola Company's Christmas advertising in the 1930s. Middle Ages A legend began to circulate in the early Middle Ages that when Jesus was born in the dead of winter, all the trees throughout the world shook off their ice and snow to produced new shoots of green. The medieval Church would decorate outdoor fir trees — known as “paradise trees” — with apples on Christmas Eve, which they called “Adam and Eve Day” and celebrated with a play. 
      But the miracles did not stop believing with us, and Santa Claus in distant Lapland( or where he lives there?) Did not stop waiting for our letters.
