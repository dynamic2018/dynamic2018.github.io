      As always, there’s no time so Santa left his sleigh and reindeers and come down ... The rest are from myself and DH, siblings, and various other family members that are wrapped and under the tree (or near the tree). 
      The reasons Christmas is popular in the United States are: retail stores make cubic tons of money; families have an excuse to get together; people can be generous in giving gifts; people will be receiving presents for just knowing someone; adults can relive being children by continuing the story and beliefs; parents can participate in the children’s fantasies of Rudolph and Santa and Elves. The headline song from the same album as the above song, "I Am Santa Claus," is a parody of Black Sabbath's "Iron Man." Of course, Santa figures prominently in many popular Christmas Songs, including such fare as "Santa Claus is Coming To Town," "Here Comes Santa Claus," "Jolly Old Saint Nicholas," "Must Be Santa," "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer," and "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus."

      Just do not put pressure on the kid, let a new list will be real and achievable actions.
