      Neither the President nor Congress exercises the power to declare a holiday that would apply to everyone in all of the states at once, the Congressional Research Service points out. As early as November, Sinterklaas and Black Peter take a boat from Spain to Holland. 
      Most days, there's even a Santa here to meet the kids. Your mama can show you that star and you will say: "Little Snow Flake," (for that is the child's name) "I'm glad you got that furniture, for you need it more than I." That is, you must write that, with your own hand, and Snow Flake will write you an answer. 
      In the mid-1800s, however, people began to use candle holders to reduce some of the danger associated with the open flames. Priced around $11, each letter also comes with a packet of reindeer food your child can sprinkle outside on Christmas Eve so Santa's team can have a little snack.

      These include requiring donors to present a photo ID when they pick up Santa letters, and redacting the children’s full names and addresses—assigning each letter a number and storing the delivery info in a database that only the postal employees who actually deliver the gifts can access. “It was different in every place it was done—some only had a letter-response campaign where they would send form letters out to the kids, there was no gift giving,” says Fontana. “In New York, we send only the gifts.” It’s a much more modern approach to playing Santa than Fanny Longfellow or John Gluck could have imagined.

      A family scene dominated the small card's centre, but unlike its English forerunner (itself only a decade older), the images on each of its four corners made no allusion to poverty, cold, or hunger. But it takes a lot MORE magic to do it without a key, and on Christmas Even he needs every bit of Christmas spirit to make sure the reindeer and sleigh can make it all around the world.) So now, any time Santa wants to get into a home without a chimney (and even some homes WITH chimneys because it's so much easier to go through the door), he simply looks for a special key left near the door or hanging around the doorknob with a note for him.
