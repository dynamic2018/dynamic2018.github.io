      Let him or her put it into an envelope addressed simply ‚ÄúSANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE.‚Äù¬† Later, secretly open the letter and write a response from Santa.¬†USPS suggests writing it on the back of your child‚Äôs letter so he or she can see the original along with Santa‚Äôs response. ‚ÄúWhen responding as Santa, make the response as personal as possible by highlighting your child‚Äôs accomplishments over the past year,‚Äù USPS suggests. ‚ÄúFor example, helping around the house, receiving good grades in a particular subject at school or participating in community service activities.‚Äù Then, put it in an envelope addressed to your child with ‚ÄúSANTA CLAUS, THE NORTH POLE‚Äù as the return address.¬† Add the proper postage¬†‚Äï USPS suggests one of its new holiday-themed stamps ‚Äï¬†then put it inside a larger envelope, also with the necessary postage. Your mama can show you that star and you will say: 'Little Snow Flake,' (for that is the child's name) 'I'm glad you got that furniture, for you need it more than I.'"
