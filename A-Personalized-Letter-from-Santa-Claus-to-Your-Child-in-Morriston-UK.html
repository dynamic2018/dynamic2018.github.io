      Some maintain Santa Claus also absorbed elements of the Germanic god Wodan, who was associated with the pagan midwinter event of Yule and led the Wild Hunt, a ghostly procession through the sky. All that is known for certain is that the German composer and arranger Carl Riedel made the carol popular in Europe by publishing a version in his collection of 'Old Czech Songs for Mixed Choir' In 1870, under the title 'Kommet Ihr Hirten' which translates into the English language as 'Come, All Ye Shepherds'.

What is Santa's address?
