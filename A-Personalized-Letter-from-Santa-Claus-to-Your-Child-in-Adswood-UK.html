      Deep down I know that we weren‚Äôt visited by a citizen of the North Pole that evening, but the mystery of it all makes it special. Anyway, Santa Claus lives at the North Pole and that's that and I'm not moving!¬† Besides, I like my Canadian postal code: H0H 0H0.¬† (HO HO HO!) Ok, ok, Santa Claus does have other places around the world.¬† I'll tell you about them too.¬† (Why do I suddenly feel a bit like his travel agent?)¬† He does visit them every year (kind of like having summer homes -- does he think he's Brad Pitt or something?)¬† But I like staying at the North Pole.¬† I'm nice and grumpy right here, thank you! 
      And, a Santa letter can set many a worried mind at ease, as each reader learns that he or she is, indeed, on Santa's "good" list! Santa crashed in Cleveland, where he encountered Howard the Duck. 
      This allows plenty of time for parents to get their requests to you, and gives the mail plenty of time to reach the children even during the busy holiday season. All you have to do is click on the inkwell on the desk and I‚Äôll help you write your letter to Santa. 
      Once your order is placed, you can track your order to see how long it will take Santa to deliver. During the off season (which is any time that isn't Christmas, I think... and possibly summer?) Santa is out of the office on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so we missed him, but his Throne is still out and you can take photos of it. 
      Twitter will use this to make your timeline better.

      When Ak, Master Woodsman of the World, exposes him to the misery and poverty of children in the outside world, Santa strives to find a way to bring joy into the lives of all children, and eventually invents toys as a principal means.

      The USPS Santa letter answering effort started in 1912 out of the historic James Farley Post Office[7] in New York, and since 1940 has been called "Operation Santa" to ensure that letters to Santa are adopted by charitable organizations, major corporations, local businesses and individuals in order to make children's holiday dreams come true from coast to coast.[49] Those seeking a North Pole holiday postmark through the USPS, are told to send their letter from Santa or a holiday greeting card by 10 December to: North Pole Holiday Postmark, Postmaster, 4141 Postmark Dr, Anchorage, AK 99530-9998.[7] In 2006, according to the UPU's 2007 study and survey of national postal operations, France's Postal Service received the most letters for Santa Claus or "P√®re No√´l" with 1,220,000 letters received from 126 countries.[54] France's Postal Service in 2007 specially recruited someone to answer the enormous volume of mail that was coming from Russia for Santa Claus.[49] Other interesting Santa letter processing information, according to the UPU's 2007 study and survey of national postal operations, are:[49] Countries whose national postal operators answer letters to Santa and other end-of-year holiday figures, and the number of letters received in 2006: Germany (500,000), Australia (117,000), Austria (6,000), Bulgaria (500), Canada (1,060,000), Spain (232,000), United States (no figure, as statistics are not kept centrally), Finland (750,000), France (1,220,000), Ireland (100,000), New Zealand (110,000), Portugal (255,000), Poland (3,000), Slovakia (85,000), Sweden (150,000), Switzerland (17,863), Ukraine (5,019), United Kingdom (750,000).
