      North Pole,Alaska, USA In the 1940's, Santa set up a small place in Alaska.  Soon other people moved in too.  Because everyone loved Santa so much, they decided to call the area North Pole, Alaska. A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates. 
      But from 1959 onward, Santa plays an important part of the Christmas scene, but elves, children, pets and toys also play significant roles.

      The Oxford Movement of the 1830s and 1840s had produced a resurgence of the traditional rituals and religious observances associated with Christmastide and, with A Christmas Carol, Dickens captured the zeitgeist of the age, while he reflected and reinforced his vision of Christmas.[98] He advocated a humanitarian focus of the holiday,[99] which influenced several aspects of Christmas that are still celebrated in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit.[100][n 14] The historian Ronald Hutton writes that Dickens "linked worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation".[101] Ruth Glancy, a professor of English literature, states that the largest impact of A Christmas Carol was the influence felt by individual readers.[102] In the spring of 1844 The Gentleman's Magazine attributed a rise of charitable giving in Britain to Dickens's novella;[103] in 1874, Robert Louis Stevenson, after reading Dickens's Christmas books, vowed to give generously to those in need;[104] and Thomas Carlyle expressed a generous hospitality by hosting two Christmas dinners after reading the book.[105] In 1867 one American businessman was so moved after attending a reading, that he closed his factory on Christmas Day and sent every employee a turkey,[71] while in the early years of the 20th century the Queen of Norway sent gifts to London's crippled children signed "With Tiny Tim's Love".[106] On the novella, the author G. 20 free printable letters to santa templates spaceships and . easy free letters from santa customize your text and design and . santa letter template 9 free word pdf psd documents download . free letter letter j logo free letter logos free letters from . best 25 letter from santa template ideas on pinterest letter . christmas letter template with santa claus hat vector free download . free santa letters download your personalized letter from santa . christmas letter template download business template . letter from santa kit with envelope template red christmas . a vintage letter for santa claus vector free download . best 25 letter from santa template ideas on pinterest letter . dear santa letter free printable downloads momdot . santa letter printable santa claus letter reindeer food bag . free printable letter to santa babble . christmas letter template for ms word u2013 download u0026 print . free printable letters from santa christmas whimsy series . free download santa u0027s stationery design editor . letter from santa template word it last week today she got a . santa claus letter free printable for kids momdot . print at home letters from santa santa claus museum . santa letter messy little monster . dear santa cliparts free download clip art free clip art on . free letter letter j logo free letter logos free letters from .
