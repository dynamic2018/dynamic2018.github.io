      Jingle in July is an annual 5-kilometer run or walk that raises funds for the Arthritis Foundation. Nicola, in Bari, Italy (they were stolen from Myra in 1087 AD). 
      NAME!!, Rudolph just whispered in my ear that the sleigh is nearly packed. On LazyTown, one of the resident Dastardly Whiplash Robbie Rotten's schemes involved dressing up as Santa.

      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!As everyone knows, this is Santa’s busiest time of year ― and it’s tough for the big guy to answer every Christmas letter himself.  So if your kids want a letter from Santa Claus (or maybe you want one yourself!), you may have to take matters into your own hands.  The United States Postal Service has some of Santa’s helpers standing by at its Anchorage post office, ready to return letters to kids complete with a “NORTH POLE” postmark.  Here’s how it works: Have your child write a letter to Santa. On top of that everything needs a new coat of paint. 
      When Ak, Master Woodsman of the World, exposes him to the misery and poverty of children in the outside world, Santa strives to find a way to bring joy into the lives of all children, and eventually invents toys as a principal means. As punishing as those temperatures may be, though, the North Pole actually has nothing on its southern counterpart at the other end of the globe. 
      There are signs explaining away their looks and temperament, but we've seen other captive reindeer around Alaska this summer and they were not ridden with issues and did not appear as unhappy as these guys. My daughter, now 4, is really getting into Christmas this year and I think she'll get a huge kick out of getting a letter from the big guy. 
      Is Santa really giving you those presents Christmas morning?
