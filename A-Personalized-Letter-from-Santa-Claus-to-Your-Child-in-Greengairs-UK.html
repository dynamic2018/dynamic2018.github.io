      The Story of Santa Claus by Joseph A McCullough blends the two, treating the topic of Santa seriously, being careful not to destroy any beliefs held by the young reader. If brightening a child's day sounds like something you would like to do, you may want to start a Santa Letters Business and Personalized Children's Letter Service. 
      If you have the time, energy and desire, you can not just write a letter to Santa Claus, but turn it into a real work of art: decorate it with drawings, appliqués, poems and other things. I guarantee all those who received a letter back, believe Santa is real. 
      Ornaments: It is now possible to buy a range of Mexican-themed ornaments online. Popular radio programs from the year 1927 onwards probably had great influence in reformatting the concept with the Santa-like costume, reindeer and Korvatunturi (Mount Ear, near Polar Circle) as its dwelling place. 
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?
