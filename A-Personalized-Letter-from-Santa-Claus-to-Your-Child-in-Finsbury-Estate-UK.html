      Oh, you mean we’re gonna talk about the actual Saint Nicholas and what we historically know about him? (Claus comes in with a sack full of toys) He’s a fat guy with toys; we’re running with that angle. You might be surprised, however, to learn she's most likely correct.  You see, even if the envelope bares nothing more than Santa's name inscribed in crayon  but with the utmost sincerity, like thousands do every year that letter will most likely make it to Santa Claus....  But what if Santa could respond to her with a personal letter of his own? 
      Under the Constitution (Article I, Section 5) the House and Senate each have the authority to punish its members for “disorderly behavior.”  Under the rules Congress has adopted, each chamber has three options for dealing with problematic colleagues. For many of these countries Baby Jesus,  el Niño Jesus, brings gifts for children. 
      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!Hurry and send Santa a free santa letter to make sure he has your Christmas wish list so Santa's Elves can prepare your presents!
