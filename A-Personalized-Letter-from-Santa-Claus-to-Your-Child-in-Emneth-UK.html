      Undo Santa Claus‏ @santaclaus 24 Dec 2013 More Been eating some delicious cookies tonight! In 1917, after learning of a fire caused by a poor family who decorated their tree with lit candles because they couldn't afford modern Christmas lights, the 15-year old entrepreneur convinced his parents to use the bulbs from their business making novelty bird cage lights to create safe and affordable strings of Christmas lights. 
      But I had trouble with those letters which you dictated through your mother and the nurses, for I am a foreigner and cannot read English writing well. Moore went as far as to elaborate on the names of Santa's reindeer, and provided a rather Americanized, secular description of the "jolly old elf." According to History.com, "Stores began to advertise Christmas shopping in 1820, and by the 1840s, newspapers were creating separate sections for holiday advertisements, which often featured images of the newly-popular Santa Claus. 
      Each letter is then put in a stamped envelope marked with the individual child's name and home address, and the return address is listed as "Santa Claus, North Pole." This envelope is then enclosed in a larger envelope and mailed to the address below. Product made with the original formula, renamed “Coca‑Cola Classic,” is returned to the market 79 days later.
