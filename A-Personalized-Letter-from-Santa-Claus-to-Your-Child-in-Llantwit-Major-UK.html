      In 1970 Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5 delivered a chart-topping Motown arrangement, and many other contemporary artists have recorded and performed various versions of the song.

      The way of filling Christmas stockings has undergone transformations with several fancy candies, chocolates, toys, muffins, etc. becoming favourites of children. By the turn of the 20th century, the public and press began complaining that children’s wishes were treated with such neglect.

      So for the first re-airing of the special in 1965, they added a brand-new scene to the special where Santa Claus' first stop on Christmas Eve is to the Island of Misfit Toys where he picks the toys up and delivers them to children. The cookies are ready!                @Sherlock Elf: Sorry Santa, I can't watch what he's doing                @KringleClaus: Hey, why are there sugarplums dancing on my head?                @Sherlock Elf: I put that boy on the Naughty List because he was screaming.                @Sherlock Elf: Santa, that little girl you wanted me to watch is being naughty again!                @KringleClaus: The elves are having a snowball fight outside again.                @KringleClaus: The elves just told me about a little boy who wouldn't brush his teeth!                @KringleClaus: Thank you Sherlock Elf for telling me that boy isn't playing nice again.                @KringleClaus: Oh Clumsy, don't make me laugh! 
      Claus is mending my red suit as I had so many holes in the knees from sliding down all of those chimneys!
