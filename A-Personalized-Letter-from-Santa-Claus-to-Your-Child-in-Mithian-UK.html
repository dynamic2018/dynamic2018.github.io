      Scott, must have traveled quite bait to be able to call this post office "the worst in the nation". You should check to see if this kind of service is in place in your home country, but keep in mind that these letters from Santa are not hugely personalized, nor can they promise any humor. 
      From porny babies to sexy Ninja Turtles to scantily clad Supreme Court justices, slices of pizza, ears of corn, for fuck’s sake — if you build it, it appears they will come. You will find that I made no mistakes about the things which you and the baby ordered in your own letters--I went down your chimney at midnight when you were asleep and delivered them all myself--and kissed both of you, too . . . . 
      Printable Santa Letters.com (noted above) also sells Christian letters for a fee.

      Alex Palmer will be discussing the history of Santa letters and signing copies of The Santa Claus Man at the National Postal Museum, on Saturday, December 12, from 3–5 p.m., as part of the annual holiday card workshop. A quick survey turns up portraits of manic stress release (“Jingle Bells”), overwrought hallucination (“Do You Hear What I Hear?”), complex Freudian trauma (“I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus”), desperate midlife lechery (“Baby, It’s Cold Outside”), forced enthusiasm (“It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year”), and thinly veiled xenophobia (“Dominick the Donkey … the Italian Christmas donkey!”). 
      Just like the real Saint Nicholas, who used his inheritance in the third century to help his needy and suffering neighbors thus inspiring the legend of Santa Claus, we are called to be gracious and compassionate to those who are small in others eyes. Note that this often simply does not apply in fiction and somehow even kids that are shown being told this still somehow end up getting to meet Santa Claus. 
      In Russia, he is called Grandfather Frost that is “ded moroz” (the second “o” has its accent and the last “z” is pronouned as “s”.) He is also called Kris Kringle - which comes from the German term “the Christ Child” ^ Back to Top Clement C. Having a Santa set up to take pictures with children is a ritual that dates back at least to 1918.[6] The area set up for this purpose is festively decorated, usually with a large throne, and is called variously "Santa's Grotto", "Santa's Workshop" or a similar term. 
      Z.: When you've got a hit like we have, Patch, the people don't wanna wait a whole year, they're dying for a sequel!
