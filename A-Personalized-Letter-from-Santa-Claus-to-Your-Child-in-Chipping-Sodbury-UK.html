      Writing to Santa can be a fun and worthwhile activity for children, and with the right Santa Claus mailing address, you can be sure your child's holiday wishes and greetings will make it to the Jolly Old Elf's mailbox.As Christmas approaches every year, many excited children want to send Santa a letter with their Christmas list, but where do they send it to?

      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?
