      A common variation is to have Santa portrayed as not a single magical being, but as a god-like office held by a mortal, such as Ernest Saves Christmas, where Santa is a normal person who spends a large chunk of his (possibly magically lengthened) lifespan as Santa Claus, then passes the title off to someone else.

      HAVE YOUR SANTA LETTER CHECKED Santa makes his list and checks it twice. XML that has been specially designed to handle such requests. 
      After previewing the letter, you enter your email address and select whether you want the free (lower-resolution) letter or the paid upgrade which includes a higher-resolution letter, an envelope design and a personalized Nice List certificate. I would still advise adults not to ask Santa for some things, but to stop at something intangible and ask for a meeting with a good guy, the recovery of a close relative, etc. 
      As in English, there is a long list of carols in Spanish too.
