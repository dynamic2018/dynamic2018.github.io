At the Reformation in 16th—17th century Europe, many Protestants changed the name of gift bringer to the Christ Child or Christkindl, which was Americanized to Kris Kringle, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.

      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?

      It Came Upon the Midnight Clear 27) The Christ Child's Lullaby 'Tàladh Chrìosda' ('Christ's lullaby'), also known as 'Tàladh ar Slànaigheir' ('The Lullaby of our Saviour'), is a Scottish carol from the Outer Hebrides, originally composed in Gaelic by Father Ranald Rankin of Fort William, and published in 1855 for the children of his parish to sing. Attempts to displace Christmas in Russia were ultimately unsuccessful, as were Soviet attempts to spread a secular version of Grandfather Frost, complete with blue coat to avoid Santa confusion, across Europe. "Everywhere they went after World War II, the Soviets tried to replace the native gift bringers in places like Poland or Bulgaria," Bowler explained. "But local people just sort of held their noses until the Soviet Union collapsed in 1989 and returned to their own traditions." Santa remains a politicized figure around the world. 
      The next year I asked my Dad about the Santa incident who replied that he had no idea who our visitor was, and that his parents didn’t know either. The getting and giving of gifts provided a means of grappling with jarring social change. 
      Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas Nick Kris Kringle Father Christmas or simply Santa Santy in Hiberno English is a legendary figure of Western . In Italy, a similar story exists about a woman called La Befana, a kindly witch who rides a broomstick down the chimneys of Italian homes to deliver toys into the stockings of lucky children. 
      Finished to describe a list of such cases, the child would be a good hint that you can make a list of these cases, actions and commitments for the next year.

The use of greenery in celebrations had a long history, as it was prominent in midwinter festivals in Babylonian, Egyptian, and Druidic cultures.[15] For the Romans evergreens were symbolic of fertility and regeneration.[16] The use of the evergreen tree in Christmas celebrations spread throughout Europe and eventually made its way to the United States, in large part through the Pennsylvania Dutch in the early 19th century.[17] The Christmas tree has traditionally been extravagantly decorated, with gifts, toys, sweets, and other ornaments hung on the tree, though now we often find gifts under the tree.[18] In the United States, the trees of choice have traditionally included the balsam fir, Douglas fir, white pine and Scotch pine.[19] Gifts Though holiday giving was an old custom, the giving of gifts at Christmas is a fairly recent innovation for Americans, the earliest account coming from German immigrants in Pennsylvania in 1745.[20] Puritans did not often exchange gifts, though exceptions are sometimes found.
