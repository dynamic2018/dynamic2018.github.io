      Although this painting does not clearly show eight reindeer, the reference to the well-known team from Clement Clarke Moore’s poem 'Twas the Night Before Christmas is obvious. Probably connected with the general "Northern Exposure" of  American Christmas lore. 
      The Christmas that Americans celebrate today seems like a timeless weaving of custom and feeling beyond the reach of history. In England, a Shropshire priest later recorded 25 of these carols in popular repertoires which were sung by 'wassailers' - people who entertained in the streets by visiting houses and communally singing for a reward of gifts, or food and drink. (Originally wassailers may have sung pagan songs to drive away evil spirits, but in the Christian world, they became the forerunners of modern day carol singers.) One of the oldest songs from this time is 'The Boar's Head Carol', of 1521, traditionally sung as a boar's head was presented on the table at a Tudor Christmas feast. 
      This story gives Santa a bit of The Lord of the Rings treatment, as there's plenty of strife and battles between the good fairies that raised Santa, and their enemies, a group of rock-monsters.
