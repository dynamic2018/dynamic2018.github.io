      Twain’s inimitable charm is on display, as is his tender relationship to his daughter, Susie. A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates.

      Neil Davis, wrote Battling Against Success in 1997, a fictionalized account of homestead life. During the Christianization of Germanic Europe, this figure may also have absorbed elements of the god Odin, who was associated with the Germanic pagan midwinter event of Yule and led the Wild Hunt, a ghostly procession through the sky.

      In this painting Santa shushes a yapping schnauzer to avoid waking a sleeping family. (Photo Credit:  ) (18) “Season’s Greetings” — 1962. The volunteer program enlists people, businesses and charities to answer kids' letters addressed for Santa Claus and other winter characters, according to a news release. “What better way to celebrate the season than to help Santa and his elves read the thousands and thousands of letters we have on hand?” New York district manager William Schnaars said. Operation Santa in New York City alone responds to more than 500,000 letters a year. 
      The year is very long and so that is a lot of things to do that I don't like! On another night Saint Nicholas set off with one more bag of gold, and threw it carefully into another stocking, so that the second daughter was provided for. 
      He said that, as an illustrator and writer who kept Christmas alive in his heart all year round, Russell would know what to do with it and as such, help spread the truth about Christmas to the children of the world.By mid-century, Christian groups began to ignore their religious differences over the meaning of Christmas and honored the day in special ways. 
      He gives a young boy a knife so that he may whittle toys for the others as Nicholas once did. In Australia Santas have been asked NOT to Ho-Ho-Ho, but say Ha-Ha-Ha instead Because saying "ho-ho-ho" could frighten children and could even be derogatory to women. 
      Martin Luther first suggested the Christkind as the bringer of gifts. 30 The Earth is closest to the Sun or at its Perihelion two weeks after the December solstice and farthest from the Sun or Aphelion, two weeks after the June Solstice.

      Thereafter no one could prevent the inevitable triumph of Moore's lovable Santa. In reality, elfhood involves stressful manual labor or office work (or both), depending on your job title with little pay, and the only benefits one can expect to receive are trivial shares of the company stock. 
      He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread; He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, And laying his finger aside of his nose, And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. Other ornaments from the late-Nineteenth, early-Twentieth century were made of pressed tin (much like many of the mechanical toys coming out of Germany at the time and those of Louis Marx later in America) with brightly colored lithographed surfaces. 
      Quite often the Santa, if and when he is detected to be fake, explains that he is not the real Santa and is helping him at this time of year.It has been long thought that Martin Luther began the tradition of bringing a fir tree into the home. 
      Elves will likely not see the world or even the actual North Pole unless they stay with the company well into adulthood; many elves end up employed in their own neighborhoods. With all of his reindeer to care for, Santa is certainly an animal lover, and he hasn't forgotten the family pet: special versions of the Original Letter from Santa are even available for that special pampered family dog or cat.
