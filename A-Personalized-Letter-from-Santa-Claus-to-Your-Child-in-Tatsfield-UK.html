      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? You want to avoid giving your home address as a return address if you are sending letters to strangers. 
      The elves are putting the finishing touches on the presents and tomorrow they are going to start wrapping them. Santa answers every letter that is sent to him, but he has so much mail it usually takes him about three days to write back to you.
