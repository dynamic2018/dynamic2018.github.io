      Optical fiber Christmas trees come in two major varieties; one resembles a traditional Christmas tree.[95] One Dallas-based company offers "holographic mylar" trees in many hues.[88] Tree-shaped objects made from such materials as cardboard,[96] glass,[97] ceramic or other materials can be found in use as tabletop decorations.

In the 1850s, Fanny Longfellow (wife of the poet Henry Wadsworth) wrote her three children letters each Christmas that commented on their behavior over the previous year and how they could improve it. “[Y]ou have picked up some naughty words which I hope you will throw away as you would sour or bitter fruit,” Santa explained in an 1853 letter. “Try to stop to think before you use any, and remember if no one else hears you God is always near.” In an era before childhood was celebrated as a distinct period of a person’s life, gratifying kids’ imaginations was less important than teaching them manners that would speed them toward adulthood.
