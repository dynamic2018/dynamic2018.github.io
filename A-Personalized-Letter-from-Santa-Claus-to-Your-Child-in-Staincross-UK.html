      3/10 X   A father who can't keep his promises, dies in a car accident. When he drives over to Laura's house, she treats him very coldly before telling him that she and Neil divorced because she was miserable in their remarriage, revealing that the new timeline has effects on other people as well.

Other details such as the names of friends, favorite activities and pleas for continued good behavior can be included in a letter from Santa that all kids would enjoy reading. 
      NAME!!, I've been checking my list and then I had my elves check it twice, and I see that you have been a good !!
