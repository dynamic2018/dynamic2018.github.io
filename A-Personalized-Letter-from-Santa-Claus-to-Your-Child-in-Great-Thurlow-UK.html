      December 6, 2013 | Rating: 3/5 | Full Review… David Parkinson Radio Times This is the most playfully amusing, inventive new cinematic Christmas fable in several decades. Whilst in those countries Saint Nicholas is celebrated as a distinct character with a religious touch separate from Christmas, Santa Claus is also making inroads as a symbol during the Christmas season. 
      When the party happens she doesn’t want to break the piñata, but then realizes that breaking it gives her and the piñata a special connection. His gift-giving role in Christmas rites probably follows from his fame as the friend of children. 
      Children who are accustomed to putting envelopes with messages under the tree and in the refrigerator, it is worth helping parents. Nicholas is still portrayed as a bearded bishop, wearing clerical robes. 
      He comes from the North, so why not reindeer?  In Scandinavia and Germany Santa comes on the 24th of December, knocking on the door like normal people. Play free 75% Skateboar at Christmas + skaters on the night of Christmas ...

      Parents grew more comfortable with paying for stamps, and children began to view the postman as an actual conduit to the Christmas figure. However, it was not something I would have chosen to read had the cover more appropriately identified the contents.
