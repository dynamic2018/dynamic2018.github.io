Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address?

Unlike some of the other sites above that let you fill-in-the-blanks online and create a one-time-use letter, Santa Letter Templates.com sells templates that can be used over and over for as many kids as you like (although you're not allowed to resell the letters).
