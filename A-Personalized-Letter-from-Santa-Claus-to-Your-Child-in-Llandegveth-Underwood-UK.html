      The image was reprinted in 1860, and by the 1870s, putting up a Christmas tree had become even more common in America.[50] Several cities in the United States with German connections lay claim to that country's first Christmas tree: Windsor Locks, Connecticut, claims that a Hessian soldier put up a Christmas tree in 1777 while imprisoned at the Noden-Reed House,[52] while the "First Christmas Tree in America" is also claimed by Easton, Pennsylvania, where German settlers purportedly erected a Christmas tree in 1816. The child rewarded the poor woodsman the glittering tree for his charity. “Paradise Play” is the origin of Christmas tree, at least some feel it.
