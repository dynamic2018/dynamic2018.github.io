      The child was really the Christ child who camouflaged. Claus will be sworn in on Monday along with other new council members during one of the council’s semi-monthly meetings. 
      Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, for instance, marked its 50th anniversary last year, airing every year since it debuted on NBC in 1964. One year later, Henry John Gauntlett set her words to music to produce the carol we know today.
