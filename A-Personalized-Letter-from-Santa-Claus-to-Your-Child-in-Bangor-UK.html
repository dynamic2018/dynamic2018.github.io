      To be precise, any star that’s within the latitude of the observer from Polaris never set. Today, this mythical character is still alive and well and is known all over the world as: Nicholas of Myra, Santa Claus or "Santa" in America. 
      University of Texas at Austin psychology professor Jacqueline Woolley posits that the deception about Santa Claus constitutes a complicated series of very large lies.[2] Writer Austin Cline posed the question: "Is it not possible that kids would find at least as much pleasure in knowing that parents are responsible for Christmas, not a supernatural stranger?" Notes Baum, L. History[edit] The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of cracker bonbons and the pulling of crackers from the early 1840s.[4] Tradition tells of how Tom Smith of London invented crackers in 1847.[5][6] He created the crackers as a development of his bon-bon sweets, which he sold in a twist of paper (the origins of the traditional sweet-wrapper). 
      Songs are traditionally sung about Santa Claus during the festive season, such as: Santa Claus Is Coming To Town, When Santa Got Stuck Up The Chimney, and I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus. We used it this year for our 3 year old & she was excited.

      Children love to receive these letters and with the templates over at Free Santa Letters, they only take a few minutes to create. Christkind or Kris Kringle was believed to deliver presents to well-behaved Swiss and German children. 
      Popular culture isn't any help -- many cartoons, etc. show Santa physically leaving unwrapped toys being left under the tree or in stockings (see The Island of Lost Toys, etc.) but others (ie: A Christmas Story) clearly show children unwrapping gifts from Santa. But I had trouble with those letters which you dictated through your mother and the nurses, for I am a foreigner and cannot read English writing well." He went on to write, "I will call at your kitchen door about nine o'clock this morning to inquire. 
      In the early 1890s, the Salvation Army needed money to pay for the free Christmas meals they provided to needy families. Gifts and gift cards can be added to the cards as well. 
      Some English singing translations preserve the reference to the “Lamb” – usually in the diminutive form “lambkin” (sometimes “Lambkin”), the latter which obscures the reference to the Infant Jesus as the Incarnate Lamb of God, rather than to a literal lamb in the field.
