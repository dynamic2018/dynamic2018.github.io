Naughty children get the Boring, but Practical gift of coal, which they can burn in the furnace for warmth over the winter; not as raw a deal as it might seem to those of us who no longer burn coal ourselves note  And lives on in the form of still giving kids who don't deserve toys practical items like tube socks.

      A painting by Friis Nybo A painting by Friis Nybo Palace of Saint Nicholas in the Moon Christmas Morning My Dear Susy Clemens, I have received and read all the letters which you and your little sister have written me . . . .Distract them from the realities of a world gone mad so that they can laugh with their breath rather than sob with their tears." Cumberbatch's heartwarming letter to Santa has already gained him the respect and admiration of his entire school, though certain cynical teachers secretly preferred the scathing letter turned in by his classmate, Tommy Yorke, who asked Santa to "consider not giving any presents to oil company executives and the politicians whose influence they buy."

      This is due to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). Although their Christmas advertising campaigns of the 1930s and 40s were key to popularising the image, Santa can be seen in his modern form decades before Coca Cola’s illustrator Haddon Sundblom got to work. 
      The Protestants won over their version of Santa here, but wasn’t freedom of religion mostly why they came over here in the first place?
