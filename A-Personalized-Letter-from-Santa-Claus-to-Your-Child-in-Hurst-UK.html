      The grave was for Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose job was given as a meal man—a corn merchant; Dickens misread the inscription as "mean man".[39][n 6] When Dickens was young he lived near a tradesman's premises with the sign "Goodge and Marney", which may have provided the name for Scrooge's former business partner.[41] For the chained Marley, Dickens had remembered a visit he had made to the Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he saw—and was affected by—seeing fettered prisoners.[34] For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the time A Christmas Carol was written.[42][n 7] The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present were inspired by the children Dickens had seen on his visit to a ragged School in the East End of London.[17] Themes[edit] Ignorance and Want from the original edition, 1843 The transformation of Scrooge is central to the story.[44] Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character, but who then grows into one who "possess[es] an emotional depth [and] a regret for lost opportunities".[45] Some writers, including Grace Moore, the Dickens scholar, consider that there is a Christian theme running through A Christmas Carol, and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the Christian concept of redemption.[46][n 8] Dickens's biographer, Claire Tomalin sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that "even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man".[48] Dickens's attitudes towards organised religion were complex,[n 9] although he based his beliefs and principles within the New Testament.[51] Dickens's statement that Marley "had no bowels" is a reference to the "bowels of compassion" mentioned in I John, the reason for his eternal damnation.[52][n 10] Other writers, including Kelly, see that Dickens put forward a "secular vision of this sacred holiday".[10] The Dickens scholar John O.

      In Miracle on 34th Street, it's a major plot point that grown-ups are skeptical whether "Kris Kringle" may or may not be the real Santa. Then a few small presents that would fit in the stocking. 
      It doesn't matter what religion, what language, what country, or what you call your special holidays: Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, New Year's or Ramadan, Christmas and Santa Claus is the spirit and happiness that comes with of unselfish giving to those we love and those in need. So Coca-Cola commissioned Michigan-born illustrator Haddon Sundblom to develop advertising images using Santa Claus — showing Santa himself, not a man dressed as Santa. 
      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!Kids, family and friends is a Free Santa Letter, Santa Stamps, Christmas Stamps, Free Online Games, free Stuff.
