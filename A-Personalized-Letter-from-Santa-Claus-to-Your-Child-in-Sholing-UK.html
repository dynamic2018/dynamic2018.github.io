      Father Christmas is now widely seen as synonymous with the Santa Claus figure. The Caracol observatory in Chichen Itza in Yucatan, Mexico shows evidence of being built as early as about 600 AD. 
      Santa's function is either to promote the store's image by distributing small gifts to children, or to provide a seasonal experience to children by listening to their wishlist while having them sit on his knee (a practice now under review by some organisations in Britain,[56] and Switzerland[57]). With this timely gift the father was able to provide for his eldest daughter and saw that she got married to a nice groom.

      In German speaking nations in the 16th century, the tradition developed of bringing very small fir trees inside and decorating them on the table next to a Nativity scene (the very first Christmas tree is apocryphally attributed to Martin Luther). In fact, one of Nicholas’s earliest cathedrals was built on the site of a temple dedicated to Poseidon and several other places dedicated to Nicholas are near those once reserved for the Greek god of the sea. 
      A more casual ending that can be used in business letters is Cordialmente. Many ancient cultures tracked the path of the sun to identify the winter solstice by aligning stones or by building astronomical observatories. 
      According to one legend, late one evening Martin Luther was walking home through the woods and noticed how beautifully the stars shone through the trees.
