      Like Saint Nicholas' relics proved centuries ago, you don't need a flesh-and-blood Santa Claus to turn a small town into a tourist destination. For North Pole, Alaska, and Rovaniemi, Finland, Santa Claus creates an economy where there are few natural attractions. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU CREATE YOUR OWN SANTA ELVES TO HELP FATHER CHRISTMAS!!! 
      Nicholas in a variety of facets, including his long white beard and his gray horse for nightly rides (see Odin's horse Sleipnir), which was traded for reindeer in North America.[18] Margaret Baker comments that "The appearance of Santa Claus or Father Christmas, whose day is 25th of December, owes much to Odin, the old blue-hooded, cloaked, white-bearded Giftbringer of the north, who rode the midwinter sky on his eight-footed steed Sleipnir, visiting his people with gifts. … Odin, transformed into Father Christmas, then Santa Claus, prospered with St Nicholas and the Christchild became a leading player on the Christmas stage." History Origins Pre-modern representations of the gift-giver from Church history and folklore, notably St Nicholas (known in Dutch as Sinterklaas), merged with the English character Father Christmas to create the character known to Americans and the rest of the English-speaking world as "Santa Claus" (a phonetic derivation of "Sinterklaas"). The other landed in a candy shop and saw a kid complain and say 'beacause he stole my candy' and that alien learned how to say because he stole my candy. 
      The kids must be bathed and tucked into bed where they will wait to hear Santa's sled. If brightening a child's day sounds like something you would like to do, you may want to start a Santa Letters Business and Personalized Children's Letter Service.

(Fun Fact: they were originally hung upside down from the ceiling—hilarious!) Long story short, Christians had lights, they had trees, and in the 17th century, they decided to put the two together.

      In the 1600s, the Protestant Reformation gained prominence and many Christmas carols were discontinued or banned as inappropriate for the solemnity of the church. You will find that I made no mistakes about the things which you and the baby ordered in your own letters--I went down your chimney at midnight when you were asleep and delivered them all myself--and kissed both of you, too . . . . 
      As we grow older, it has become uninteresting for us to write a letter to Santa Claus so that he will certainly read it and bring exactly the gift we wanted. When creating your templates on a word processor, leave spaces where you will be able to input personal information such as the child's name, one gift she wants for Christmas and the city she lives in. 
      It is said that in the 16th Century, the children staying in Holland kept their clogs, filled with straw, by the hearth for the reindeer. As the child grows, the collection of letters will grow with them, and create a record of their lives and achievements.
