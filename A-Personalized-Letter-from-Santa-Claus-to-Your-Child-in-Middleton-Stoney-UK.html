      Our last lot of kitchen furniture for dolls has just gone to a very poor little child in the North Star away up, in the cold country above the Big Dipper. It can be a fun way to take a trip down memory lane years later to see what they were most excited about when they were a child.   If you want to make it as easy as possible to write a letter to Santa, a template is a good option. 
      Real trees are popular with high end visual merchandising displays around the world. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      He fulfills the cherished wishes of the night before the New Year, gives the desired gifts and joy. What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus? 
      Santa Claus truly existed three hundred years after Jesus Christ was born. In reality, Sam has just been suffering really bad luck after losing a cursed Rabbit's Foot. 
      The Dutch settlers in New Amsterdam (New York) brought this fun and lively tradition (some even say cult) to America.

      Tree worship was common among the pagan Europeans and survived their conversion to Christianity in the Scandinavian customs of decorating the house and barn with evergreens at the New Year to scare away the devil and of setting up a tree for the birds during Christmas time."[10] During the Roman mid-winter festival of Saturnalia, houses were decorated with wreaths of evergreen plants, along with other antecedent customs now associated with Christmas.[11] The modern Christmas tree is frequently traced to the symbolism of trees in pre-Christian winter rites, wherein Viking and Saxon worshiped trees.[11] The story of Saint Boniface cutting down Donar's Oak illustrates the pagan practices in 8th century among the Germans. Then when I say "Good-by and a merry Christmas to my little Susy Clemens," you must say "Good-by, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much."

      In "The Living Holiday Lights," from Special Agent Oso, when Whirlybird appears to ferry Oso across the sea to the United States, he asks if Oso was expecting Santa Claus. Nothing is more adorable than a young kid’s belief in things pure and fun.  That’s why Santa Claus and Christmas is so popular.

      NC: Hey, trust me, you being interpreted as a strong muscular Santa is not everything it’s cracked up to be.

In this poem Santa is established as a heavyset elf with eight reindeer, who are named here for the first time.
