      How and exactly when the words of 'Veni veni Emmanuel' became united with the funeral hymn is unknown, but certainly it had happened by 1851, when John Mason Neale translated the words from Latin into English (Neale was a prolific translator of hymns and carols from many other languages into English, as well as composing some carols of his own, including 'Good King Wenceslas'.) When Neale wrote the English language version of the carol, he titled it 'Draw nigh, draw nigh, Emmanuel', but later modifications of the text gave us the title and verses we know today. Sprite Boy, who was also created by Sundblom, got his name due to the fact that he was a sprite, or an elf. (It wasn’t until the 1960s that Coca-Cola introduced the popular beverage Sprite.) 1953: ‘The pause that refreshes’ ‘The pause that refreshes’ was one of the longest-lasting slogans in Coke history, first introduced in 1929.

"They were first brought to America in the 19th century," says Fritz Karch, an antiques dealer based in Hopewell, New Jersey, and an avid collector of ornaments, who curated this story.

      He and Jack are sent back in time to his front yard, where, twelve years earlier, he caused Santa to fall off the roof and donned his coat to become the new Santa. Stores began to advertise Christmas shopping in 1820, and by the 1840s, newspapers were creating separate sections for holiday advertisements, which often featured images of the newly-popular Santa Claus.

      Then when I say “Good bye and a merry Christmas to my little Susie Clemens,” you must say “Good bye, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much and please tell that little Snow Flake I will look at her star tonight and she must look down here—I will be right in the west bay window; and every fine night I will look at her star and say, ‘I know somebody up there and likeher, too.'” Then you must go down into the library and make George close all the doors that open into the main hall, and everybody must keep still for a little while.

      Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau agreed, saying: "Everyone knows that Santa Claus is Canadian. "His postal code is H0H 0H0,'' he said, alluding to a mailing address assigned to Santa by Canada Post. (The postal service responds each year to tens of thousands of children's letters from around the world addressed to Santa Claus, North Pole, H0H 0H0, Canada.)
