      More Printable Free Letters From Santa There are many other places that you can get templates for free letters from Santa. I explained that I had many questions as both a journalist and a Christmas enthusiast. 
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!)

      What child wouldn’t be thrilled to receive a letter from Santa? 6/10 X   One year after Kevin was left home alone and had to defeat a pair of bumbling burglars, he accidentally finds himself in New York City, and the same criminals are not far behind.The Santa Clause "The Santa Clause" provides at least one valuable service: It explains exactly how Santa is able to get down chimneys that are too small for him, and how he is able to enter apartments through hot water radiators and heating vents.

      Leave it there always in memory of my visit; and whenever you look at it or show it to anybody you must let it remind you to be a good little girl.

      On the other hand, Santa himself better watch out if he finds himself at a Philadelphia Eagles game, lest he get booed and has to dodge snowballs. note  A young man dressed as Santa really did get booed and pelted with snowballs by Eagles fans during the halftime show in a game against the Minnesota Vikings on December 15, 1968, but it was more from frustration by the fanbase at a terrible 2-11 season put forth by the team that year; overall hatred of the team's owner, coach, and quarterback; and the miserable weather (the man himself was a replacement - the original Santa couldn't go due to the weather - and his beard was unconvincing).
