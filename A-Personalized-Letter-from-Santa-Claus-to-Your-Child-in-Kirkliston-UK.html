      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? If this is the case, youʼll just need to enter the CAPTCHA code once, and weʼll be able to distinguish between you and the other users on your IP address. 
      The cartoonist Thomas Nast established the bounds for Santa Claus’ current look with an initial illustration in an 1863 issue of Harper’s Weekly, as part of a large illustration titled “A Christmas Furlough”. In the Phineas and Ferb Christmas special, Santa is revealed as The Chessmaster behind the misadventures in the episode, which he arranged so that everyone could get what they really wanted for Christmas, including giving Phineas a chance to take on the role of Santa, his hero. 
      At the end, a letter from 1 Rudolph Way will pop up and summarize what Santa said.JB "I like how this article gave you step-by-step instructions on how to write to Santa Claus." L "It helped me by giving me cool ideas about how to write and decorate my Santa letter." A "I use this site for my English class, we are about to write Santa letters. But I had trouble with those letters which you dictated through your mother and the nurses, for I am a foreigner and cannot read English writing well. 
      Itʼs also possible that your computer has been infected with a Spambot virus thatʼs using your computer to gather information. Ask Santa to implement all his plans, health, luck, and perhaps some gifts. 
      If this is the case, youʼll just need to enter the CAPTCHA code once, and weʼll be able to distinguish between you and the other users on your IP address.
