      North Pole: The home of the American Father Christmas. Kids often want a lot of things at once, and often such gifts can not afford the parents (so we know you, on whose money 'fly gifts from Santa Claus ").

      In Nordic countries the original bringer of gifts at Christmas time was the Yule Goat, a somewhat startling figure with horns. One's body of the essay also needs to contain facts. 
      K: Writing a book that incorporates two separate tradition lines (American history and American Christmas pastimes) was a tall order, but Christmas in America does both and well. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      Previous images feature Santa as the main subject.

      This sure is a busy time for me in the Mailroom, every time I turn around there’s another bag for me to sort! Nicholas — only nowadays, we hang stockings rather than leaving boots by the chimney! 
      Each letter template comes with the text for three alternate letters and two envelope designs, so you'll pay once and then be able to edit and modify your letter as m any times as you want. With all of his reindeer to care for, Santa is certainly an animal lover, and he hasn't forgotten the family pet: special versions of the Original Letter from Santa are even available for that special pampered family dog or cat. 
      In Germany, children get presents from Christkind (Christkindl in Austria and South Germany), the Christ Child.

      Ebert also had some praise for Lithgow's "nice, hateful performance", but wrote that "the villain is not drawn big enough." He ceded that young children would probably like most of the film, but that older children and adults are "likely to find a lot of it a little thin."[4] Vincent Canby of The New York Times was less positive than Ebert, calling the production "elaborate and tacky".
