      The role of the Ancient Elf was written with James Cagney in mind; however, with Cagney being very weak in his old age, the legendary actor could not adequately assume the role, despite the fact that he liked the film's overall idea. The joyful anticipation of unknown treasures when morning finally arrived. 
      Life on the range can be very lonely swapping long shifts keeping watchful eye for cattle rustlers, robbers and Indians never knowing what appears from the dark sky. There are quite a few styles of Christmas borders here so choose the one you think your child will like the best from Santa, snowmen, gingerbread men, and globes.

      I don’t want you kiddos to forget about Jesus as you prepare for Christmas.  I want you to enjoy all the fun – hot chocolate, singing Christmas songs, candy and presents – but I don’t want you to forget the most important present: God’s love for us and His son, Jesus.  I don’t want you to forget that it’s still important to love others … to be nice to other people … to help other people (even your Mommy, Daddy, and each other) … to show other people how wonderful Jesus is. I really appreciated the fact that this book integrated a cultural celebration in a very subtle way.
