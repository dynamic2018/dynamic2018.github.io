      MAUD LINDSAY, "Santa Claus, a Wonder Story for Little Children" 16 likes Tags: Maud Lindsay Santa Claus is anyone who loves another and seeks to make them happy; who gives himself by thought or word or deed in every gift that he bestows; who shares his joys with those who are sad; whose hand is never closed against the needy; whose arm is ever outstretched to aid the weak; whose sympathy is quick and genuine in time of trouble; who recognizes a comrade and brother in every man he meets upon life's common road; who lives his life throughout the entire year in the Christmas spirit.

      Santa's secret home was revealed in 1927 on the popular Finnish Children's Hour radio show by Uncle Markus, Markus Rautio.  Uncle Markus explained about the special mountain called Korvatunturi or Ear Mountain.  The mountain looks like a big set of rabbit ears.  Of course, the elves figured out long ago how to use the ears to listen to which children around the world were being naughty.  North Pole,Alaska, USA In the 1940's, Santa set up a small place in Alaska.  Soon other people moved in too.  Because everyone loved Santa so much, they decided to call the area North Pole, Alaska.
