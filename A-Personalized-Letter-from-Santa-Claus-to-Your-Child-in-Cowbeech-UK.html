      I have written articles on many subjects including science and history, politics and philosophy, film reviews and travel guides, as well as poems and stories. As for this Christmas, I have already gone over budget and have only bought for a few people.  This year I bought for myself too (Lego time!).  Last year I bought myself the Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi.  For this year I was going to buy myself a higher end camera but instead settled on buying myself a lot of Lego train items (beware, Lego is suppose to be doing away with the 9 volt Lego trains). 
      If you start with the first lines of demanding gifts, then the symbol of the New Year is sure to be offended and will ignore such a cheeky appeal. I took to be "a trunk full of doll's clothes." Is that it? 
      At the post office you can buy postcards, souvenirs made in Finland.
