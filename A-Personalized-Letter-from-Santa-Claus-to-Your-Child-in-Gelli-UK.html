      For orders going outside the United States, we must receive your order by November 20th. Wait a few minutes for your letter to reach the North Pole -- it's pretty far away, after all -- and then Santa will appear on your screen. 
      Keep trying to improve your top score with each flight! Children can then take their letters, in a correctly addressed envelope to the post office, have it stamped for the North Pole and be confident that it will reach its North Pole destination. 
      Every year, more than half a million children write letters to Santa's official post office, where elves sort all the arrivals by country of origin. Nostros watches from afar, scoffing at their attempt to do the impossible and forbidding Clement from involving himself. 
      You can participate in local fundraisers for schools and children's charities, you can set up a booth at a craft show or flea market, and you can even approach businesses and offer them a commission for selling your Santa letters. This is done during the Christmas season, traditionally known as Advent. 
      If you come across any problems or wish to ask a question, please do not hesitate to contact our Support service using the contact us form.Our Santa Letters have been a holiday tradition for generations.
