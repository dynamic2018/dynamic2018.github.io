      Alright, I’ll share my Lego shopping list with you as long as you do me a favor.  This is going to be one of those favors that actually should make you feel really good about yourself.  You need to order a Santa letter.  The process is easy and quick and you will be making some child (or children) very happy.  This is sort of like my random restaurant thing, only I will feel much better about the Santa letter surprise.

In spite of you being changed into different colours for corporations and being bastardised to represent materialism gone mad — despite probably originating in some season based pagan druid ritual a million thought miles from requests for spontaneously combusting hoverboards … Kidadults cynically pointing this out after having their moment of belief in you are wasting everyone’s precious time.
