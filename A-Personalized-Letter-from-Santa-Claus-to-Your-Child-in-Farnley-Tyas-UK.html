      By 1890, the Clone changed his name to “Santa” in order to escape tax collection, and decided to leave the United States for good,because he realized that one day, it would be run by Barack Obama (see Pokemon). Individuals can volunteer to answer a Santa letter (or several), then it is up to that donor to buy the requested gift and bring it to the post office to send to the child.
