      Santa just created a letter for Annabelle from Land O' Lakes - Guaranteed to arrive before Xmas! 
      If you say it was, I shall ask you what color you want the trunk to be . . . and then you must tell me every single thing in detail which you want the trunk to contain.There are some things you can do, however, to help them believe in their reply letters from Santa. 
      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus? 
      And the resulting 'right jolly old elf' is now the universally recognised symbol of Christmas.Page 1 of 2 Here Comes Santa Claus by Gene Autry In 1946, Gene Autry was Grand Marshal and the only movie star that was part of the Santa Claus Lane Parade.
