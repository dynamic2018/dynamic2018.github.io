      Santa Clause Letters Website The first thing you will need to do is start a website. >Specifically, you need to use the same platform that I used to create this website (yes, I'll tell you all my secrets....) SBI. Here's some advice on how to help the Jolly Old Elf send a Santa letter to your little one, complete with a postmark from the North Pole.
