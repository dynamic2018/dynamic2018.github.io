      If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. One letter in Letters to Santa comes from an adult woman asking Santa to bring her a “tall, stately, well-bred…man of wealth with a steady income,” while in another, a boy negotiates with Santa to “trade you my sister when she comes from the stork for an elf.” A number of poorer children writing at the start of the 20th century even ask for coal—seeking warmth rather than viewing it as a punishment for naughtiness. 
      See how easy it is to create a free letter from Santa and feel your heart warm as your child gets the biggest Christmas smile of all on their face.
