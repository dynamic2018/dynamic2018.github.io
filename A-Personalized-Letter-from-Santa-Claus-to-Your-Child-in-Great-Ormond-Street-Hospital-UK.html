      We're Going to Disney Connect-the-Dots Printable to get the trip started in style! And what to their wondering eyes should appear, but a great big sleigh and eight giant reindeer, up on the house. 
      What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus? Well, let's see.  Right now, he's at the North Pole.  Mind you, he does move around a lot.  But, yes, I think his address is always The North Pole!

"Twas the Night Before Christmas" introduced the reindeer Clement Moore's 1822 poem A Visit From Saint Nicholas — which is now more commonly referred to as "Twas the Night Before Christmas" — was first published anonymously in the Troy, N.
