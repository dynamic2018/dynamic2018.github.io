      Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time! Only the royal and upper class members of the society used to wear the wreaths as headbands, sometimes along with jewels. 
      They have a HUGE selection of Christmas decorations and ornaments that are so adorable it'd make you want to get everything! This gift will replace individual letters to students in schools and daycares, and will eliminate concerns raised by parents about inconsistent responses from Santa when letters are written at school and also at home.

In 1821 an uncredited poem appeared in a small book entitled The Children’s Friend: A New Year’s Present, to Little Ones From Five to Twelve. 
      Like Sundblom’s depictions for Coca Cola more than a decade later, these pictures of Rockwell’s give a very physiologically human and naturalistic aspect to the character as opposed to the more cartoonish features which had gone before.

      The letters are read and then the elves help Santa by writing letters back, in English, to the children. The process was probably a continuous amalgamation of many old folk customs and beliefs from varied sources. 
      It has a thick, green-striped outer rind and pale green to white inner flesh with a mild melon flavour and sweetness close to honeydew melons. When other kids said Santa brought them a bike I would think to myself 'no they didn't silly, Santa doesn't bring the big stuff' f farmwife1979 @ld8569 One large or two smaller gifts from Santa, wrapped in special paper (got a deal on a huge roll at Sams Club -Santa has used the same paper for 7 years now). 
      A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates. I figured if Santa was going to have an email account, it would be Google-based. 
      Maybe you will not hear my footsteps at all--so you may go now and then and peep through the dining-room doors, and by and by you will see that thing which you want, right under the piano in the drawing room-for I shall put it there.

      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? When is the deadline for ordering for Christmas delivery?
