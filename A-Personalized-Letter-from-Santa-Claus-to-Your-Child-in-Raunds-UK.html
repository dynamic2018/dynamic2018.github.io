      There is a huge market when it comes to Santa Clause letters and other holiday letters. The two friends buckle themselves into the incredible Patchmobile, which they have stuffed with loads and loads of the candy canes. 
      If you indeed celebrate Christmas as the birthday of Christ, then the Christmas wreath is said to represent the preparation of the coming of Christ. Not to mention --- when you send a letter to Santa Claus, from anywhere in the world, in any language, using the normal postal service, they all end up in Santa's Official Post Office in Rovaniemi, Finland. 
      I'm probably going to do the same thing with my twins.  G GlksBaby @ld8569 In my childhood Christmas was more about family than Santa, Christmas Eve was always the bigger deal (Italian...the fishes) and the gifts we got from each other/parents/grandparents were always the best gifts (like a bike would be a gift from my parents). And he's used to presents being wrapped, from us. 
      A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates. Most of the adult population will say that writing a letter to Father Frost in adulthood is a waste of time. 
      However, the celebration of Epiphany is not just in Puerto Rico.

(He pours brandy in both wine glasses for himself and Towzer) By next December, they’ll be writing to me! (He clinks glasses with Towzer’s) B. By the end of the nineteenth century, this tradition of an elf bringing Christmas presents had also spread to Norway Finland, and Sweden, replacing the Yule Goat. 
      If you would prefer your business to have a more traditional letter-type approach, and you would like to add stickers and reindeer poop to your letters instead of photos of the children, then this would be a better option for you. The Ninth Reindeer Rudolph, “the most famous reindeer of all,” was born over a hundred years after his eight flying counterparts.
