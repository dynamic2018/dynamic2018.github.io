      That's why I've asked my elves to make you a special present that I can bring to you on Christmas Eve when I come to ________child's city________. In Germany 'Weihnactsmann' (Christmas man) dresses up as 'Nikolaus' and brings sweets, fruits, nuts and smaller presents to children on December 6th.   ^ Back to Top Grandfather Frost The Russian Grandfather Frost has strong Pagan relations. 
      This character is based on the story of Saint Nicholas, a Christian holy person believed to have lived in the third century. Europeans liked to use small Christmas trees of 4 feet height where as Americans preferred gigantic Christmas trees, length of which varied enormously. 
      Santa Claus is called Papa Noel and some children receive presents both days on December 24th (from Papa Noel) and on January 6th (from the Three Kings). What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus? 
      Children should always ask for help from parents and other adults in writing this message in order to properly compile and arrange it, as well as specify the exact address. Immediately after the appeal, you can ask: "How are you?", "How do you feel?", "How are you?". 
      Well, I have to go check on the reindeer and see if they're getting in shape for the big night.
