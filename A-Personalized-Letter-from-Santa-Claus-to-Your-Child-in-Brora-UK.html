(See Poles of astronomical bodies.) Alpha Pictoris is the south pole star of Mercury while Omicron Draconis is the north star.[14] 42 Draconis is the closest star to the northern pole of Venus. 
      Of course Santa Claus knows if you have been naughty or nice (but I'm sure it does not hurt to remind Santa how nice you have been to your parents, siblings and friends).

So now, any time Santa wants to get into a home without a chimney (and even some homes WITH chimneys because it's so much easier to go through the door), he simply looks for a special key left near the door or hanging around the doorknob with a note for him.
