      An automobile version of Santa Claus named Santa Car (a vehicle resembling a Dusenburg) actually appears in storybook based on the film Cars called "Mater Saves Christmas." In Caillou's Holiday Movie, the "Where Santa Has a Different Name" song provides details on Christmas traditions around the world, including Denmark, Slovakia and Greece. 
      The 19th century American cartoonist Nast who had lived on the same West 23rd Street as Dr.North Pole,Alaska, USA In the 1940's, Santa set up a small place in Alaska.  Soon other people moved in too.  Because everyone loved Santa so much, they decided to call the area North Pole, Alaska.

      Another year, the Doorman (DeMarr David), who had recently been drafted as the Avatar of Oblivion, encountered Santa and asked him for a Christmas miracle for his dad: "Some toy he'd always longed for ever since he was a kid, something to teach him the true meaning of Christmas and help forge a bond between father and son?" Unfortunately, as Christmas Eve was Santa's busiest time of year, he didn't have time to help out Doorman, though later he was able to join Doorman and his teammates (then the GLX/Great Lakes X-Men) on their Christmas celebration.[citation needed] Powers and Abilities Powers Santa Claus has a number of magical abilities, including longevity, the ability to fit himself and others through any chimney (avoiding fiery injury in the process), levitate up a chimney (usually by touching his nose and nodding), alter the appearance of himself or other objects or beings (including physically transforming a person into an inanimate object), change the size of other objects, teleport himself and others across the world, generate snow and determine who has been naughty or nice. The Russian Ded Moroz ("Grandfather Frost") and German Väterchen Frost share some characteristics with the British Old Winter.[3] In many Eastern Othodox traditions, Santa Claus is identified with Saint Basil the Great, Archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, Asia Minor (contemporary Turkey) whose memory is celebrated on that day.
