      The letters from Santa Clause are then printed in beautiful colors, stuffed into a real envelope, stamped with a real stamp (not metered postage) and sent for you. Instead of having to write a letter from scratch on blank paper, kids can just fill in the blanks on one of these templates. 
      Is this a regional thing? (Our families come from two different parts of the country.) Or just random decisions made in each household?

      Make sure you put your own Name and Address at the top of the letter so Santa will know where to write you back. It's totally touristy, but was pretty fun for me, since I'm a kid at heart. 
      Synopsis Somewhere in the 14th Century, Claus is a peasant woodcutter in his mid-50s who, with his wife Anya, delivers his rapings to the children of a certain village. When I look out my workshop window, I see several of my elves training the reindeer so they'll be ready to fly on Christmas Eve. 
      So Rudolph has seen a number of edits over the years, with songs being trimmed, songs being cut and whole scenes being eliminated entirely. You must tell George he must walk on tiptoe and not speak-- otherwise he will die someday. 
      Well, I'm just a grumpy elf but even I know how to do that!  Just go to this page and send your Christmas wishes to Santa Claus!  No email or home address, phone number or last name required!  Then hit the send button to get a safe, free reply fast as reindeer fly!  You can choose between a regular instant reply on your screen or one that connects you to Santa's North Pole webcam for a free video reply.  (Just don't tell him a grumpy elf sent you!)

      Nicholas.” Moore’s poem, which he was initially hesitant to publish due to the frivolous nature of its subject, is largely responsible for our modern image of Santa Claus as a “right jolly old elf” with a portly figure and the supernatural ability to ascend a chimney with a mere nod of his head! The same evening, the daughters of the nobleman had washed their clothes and had hung their stockings by the fireplace.

      George must not use a broom, but a rag--else he will die someday . . . . 
      Twain, being a writer, couldn't stand for his young daughter to feel like her work went unheard, so he decided to pen the following letter to "My Dear Susie Clemens" from "The Man in the Moon" himself.Luckily, they are relatively inexpensive these days!

      What's important to monitor is whether the warming becomes part of a pattern that reduces sea ice in the Arctic, something scientists are watching closely. "Some climate models predict an ice-free Arctic at least part of the year in the coming decades," Miller said. "If you're going to have an ice-free Arctic and you're going to have big melts in the summertime but also limit ice recovery in the winter, you're going to have to have events like this happen." He continued, "If you have a lot of these events, especially with strong winds that can push that sea ice around and cause some vulnerabilities, if this is a pattern of things to come, it could really become worrisome for the stability of the Arctic." Incidentally, if you want to travel to the relative warmth of the North Pole, you may want to bring a lamp.All stories of Santa Claus and his cheery toy-making elves aside, the North Pole is a brutally cold, inhospitable place that has claimed the lives of countless explorers who attempted to venture there.

Nicholas in Early New York Early Dutch settlers of New York considered St. 
      What you can hear in the words of Mark Twain's Santa is a parent who, in this season and all others, wants to give his child the world. "... I'll eat them all myself!" Despite this, he manages to get the Deegan twins (the sons of the widow in the film) to tell him their true Christmas wish, which, in a twist, isn't something like wanting their father back or seeing their mother happy (though they would like this), but rather to have an earwig farm. 
      As postal workers began hand-delivering mail to urban centers during the Civil War, Americans began to view the mail as a pleasant surprise arriving at one’s door, rather than a burdensome errand.
