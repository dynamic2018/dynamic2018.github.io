      After his presentation and description of good works, proceed to the main stage of letter writing. Promise Santa Claus to be an active, cheerful and cheerful person who strives for the best and always achieves his goals. 
      Santa answers every letter that is sent to him, but he has so much mail it usually takes him about three days to write back to you. Wear your own Disney shirt if you’ve got one, and drop comments if you have to (“Hey, remember the last time we ate this?”). 
      Anyway, Santa Claus lives at the North Pole and that's that and I'm not moving!  Besides, I like my Canadian postal code: H0H 0H0.  (HO HO HO!) Ok, ok, Santa Claus does have other places around the world.  I'll tell you about them too.  (Why do I suddenly feel a bit like his travel agent?)  He does visit them every year (kind of like having summer homes -- does he think he's Brad Pitt or something?)  But I like staying at the North Pole.  I'm nice and grumpy right here, thank you! The dog in Sundblom’s 1964 Santa Claus painting was actually a gray poodle belonging to the neighborhood florist. 
      At a very young age, it's okay to be evasive, change the subject, ask them "what do you think?" Once they begin questioning his existence day in and day out, it's time they know the truth. All of this overshadowed the stories the author was trying to tell, the text and formatting need a lot of work before I would recommend it to anyone. 
      After a moment of confusion you'll hear these three words, nothing else, and then he will disappear.

      As for this Christmas, I have already gone over budget and have only bought for a few people.  This year I bought for myself too (Lego time!).  Last year I bought myself the Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi.  For this year I was going to buy myself a higher end camera but instead settled on buying myself a lot of Lego train items (beware, Lego is suppose to be doing away with the 9 volt Lego trains). There are also a variety of places where you can send $5-10 and get a letter back.
