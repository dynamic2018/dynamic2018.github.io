      A correspondent for the Stark County Democrat, in Canton, Ohio, noted the following year: “One day last week two bright little children entered the Democrat office and wanted us to print letters to Santa Claus, from them.” The gifts that kids requested in this period tended to be simple and practical. Dear Santa includes letters written during the 1870s that ask for gifts such as writing desks, prayer books, and “a stick of pomade” for “papa.” As society changed, the children started to ask for more fun items, such as candy, dolls, and roller skates.

      A boy from Colorado writing to the children's magazine The Nursery in late 1874 said, "If we did not live so very far from the North Pole, I should ask Santa Claus to bring me a donkey."[4] The idea of a wife for Santa Claus may have been the creation of American authors, beginning in the mid-19th century. Think about what you would be willing to spend to have a personalized letter sent to your child from “Santa” and that will give you a good starting point for the price.  Factor in your costs – stationary, postage, and printer ink – then add a little to the price of the letter to help pay for those items.

      This "history" is more like a treatise to convince children that Santa Claus is real, instead of helping us understand the man behind the legend. 
      The best first thing to describe the author of the letter.Through personal gifts, Americans mediated the fragile relationships of an increasingly fragmented society. 
      The town exploits its name as much as possible, with streets (Mistletoe Drive, Candy Cane Lane, not to mention a road for each of the reindeer), lakes (Christmas, Holly and Noel) and entire subdivisions (Christmas Lake Village, Holiday Village) following the theme.
