Father Christmas as pictured in Josiah King’s The Examination and Tryal of Father Christmas (1686) – Source The earliest English examples of the personification of Christmas are thought to be from a 15th century carol which refers to a “Sire Christmas”. 
      Santa answers every letter that is sent to him, but he has so much mail it usually takes him about three days to write back to you. Oh, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! (Everyone begins dancing around the workshop joyously) At least that would be what happened if this all wasn’t just a hallucinogenic dream followed by death. (The joyous dance scene fades into the blizzard scene from the beginning of the film with Claus and Anya huddled together, freezing to death) NC: (chuckles as he speaks) Okay, okay, that’s not the real ending, but wouldn’t that be awesome? (Clips from the movie play again as NC speaks) NC (voiceover): So that’s “Santa Claus: The Movie.” It’s stupid, it’s corny, and it has a lot of slow moments, but to its credit, I do kind of admire it at times.

Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!As everyone knows, this is Santa’s busiest time of year ― and it’s tough for the big guy to answer every Christmas letter himself.  So if your kids want a letter from Santa Claus (or maybe you want one yourself!), you may have to take matters into your own hands.  The United States Postal Service has some of Santa’s helpers standing by at its Anchorage post office, ready to return letters to kids complete with a “NORTH POLE” postmark.  Here’s how it works: Have your child write a letter to Santa.
