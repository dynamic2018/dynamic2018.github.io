"Some climate models predict an ice-free Arctic at least part of the year in the coming decades," Miller said. "If you're going to have an ice-free Arctic and you're going to have big melts in the summertime but also limit ice recovery in the winter, you're going to have to have events like this happen."

On Metacritic, the film has a score of 32 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[3] Eric D.
