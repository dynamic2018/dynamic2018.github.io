      There aren't any Christmas Day celebrations in Mexico because this is considered a day to relax and be with family. If children are in one home, or if there are several children from the same neighborhood, you will want each child to feel as though he's received a personalized letter. 
      Santa does not have an email address, according to Canada Post. Dahl and Gaske sold some of the homestead as lots and turned others into a used car shop and grocery store. 
      In 2009, the Brazilian National Post Service, "Correios" answered almost two million children's letters, and spread some seasonal cheer by donating 414,000 Christmas gifts to some of Brazil's neediest citizens.[50] Through the years, the Finnish Santa Claus (Joulupukki or "Yule Goat") has received over eight million letters. And adults are rarely present themselves as better to write such a letter. 
      What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus? With an average winter temperature of -79° F, the South Pole is a great deal colder than the North Pole.

      The "No Christmas" policy was reiterated by Parliament in 1652 with the following resolution: "That no observation shall be had of the five and twentieth day of December commonly called Christmas-Day; nor any solemnity used or exercised in churches upon the day in respect thereof." Though this policy was not enforced in Virginia, it is easy to speculate that this is at least one of the reasons that seventeenth- and eighteenth-century colonists were fairly close-mouthed about the celebration of Christmas.On 23 December 2008, Jason Kenney, Canada's minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, formally awarded Canadian citizenship status to Santa Claus. "The Government of Canada wishes Santa the very best in his Christmas Eve duties and wants to let him know that, as a Canadian citizen, he has the automatic right to re-enter Canada once his trip around the world is complete," Kenney said in an official statement.[5] There is also a city named North Pole in Alaska where a tourist attraction known as the "Santa Claus House" has been established.
