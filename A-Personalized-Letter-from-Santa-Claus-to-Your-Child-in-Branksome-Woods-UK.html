A common variation is to have Santa portrayed as not a single magical being, but as a god-like office held by a mortal, such as Ernest Saves Christmas, where Santa is a normal person who spends a large chunk of his (possibly magically lengthened) lifespan as Santa Claus, then passes the title off to someone else.

      You cannot receive a refund if you have placed a ShippingPass-eligible order. But where I found the children naughty, In manners rude, in temper haughty, Thankless to parents, liars, swearers, Boxers, or cheats, or base tale-bearers, I left a long, black, birchen rod, Such as the dread command of God Directs a Parent’s hand to use When virtue’s path his sons refuse.

Whether you choose to space your Christmas wrapping out over several days or decide to do them all in one sitting, when is the right time to put your presents under the tree?

The lower-resolution version is free, or you can select the professional quality version that for under $5 comes with an envelope and a Nice List certificate.
