      Santa Claus Personalized Santa letter #2 Dear _____________________, I've made my list and checked it twice, and I see that you've been a very good _____boy or girl_____ this year! During most of his 29 years at Clear, Collins worked the graveyard shift to ensure breakfast for the contractors, military personnel and visitors who ate there would be ready in the morning. 
      You can choose from a variety of wording best suited to your child. Our big friend the great white enjoys ambushing seals. 
      Amaze your child with a Santa letter personalized from Santa Claus. Last minute rituals for children before going to bed include aligning stockings at the mantelpiece or other place where Santa cannot fail to see them, peeking up the chimney (in homes with a fireplace), glancing out a window and scanning the heavens for Santa's sleigh, and (in homes without a fireplace) unlocking an exterior door so Santa can easily enter the house. 
      I will go to the moon and get those things and in a few minutes I will come down the chimney that belongs to the fireplace that is in the hall—if it is a trunk you want--because I couldn't get such a thing as a trunk down the nursery chimney, you know... You best arrest yourself, you broke your own law!

      In his Dutch form of Sinterklaas he was imagined to carry a staff, ride above the rooftops (on a huge white horse) and have mischievous helpers who listened at chimneys to find out whether children were being bad or good.
