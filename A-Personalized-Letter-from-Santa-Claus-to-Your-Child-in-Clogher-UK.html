      Dear {NAME}, I look forward to Christmas all year long because I love visiting little children all over the world and bringing them gifts. Live performances of the song often saw the band encouraging the audience to sing some of the lyrics with—or in place of—the band's vocalists (usually the line "you'd better be good for goodness sake", and occasionally the key line "Santa Claus is Comin' to Town" as well). 
      If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. If you say it was, I shall ask you what color you want the trunk to be . . . and then you must tell me every single thing in detail which you want the trunk to contain. 
      The rest are from myself and DH, siblings, and various other family members that are wrapped and under the tree (or near the tree). As exciting as the birth of Christ is, the true meaning of Christmas often gets lost in the hype of present-giving, the hustle and bustle of gatherings, and the financial strain on our checkbook. 
      Please note that by continuing to use the canadapost.ca website, you are agreeing to the updated Terms of Use in their entirety (and not just the changes we have summarized above).Have your child mail their own letter to santa package from. Whenever you are naughty and someone points to that mark which your good old Santa Claus's boot made on the marble, what will you say, little sweetheart?
