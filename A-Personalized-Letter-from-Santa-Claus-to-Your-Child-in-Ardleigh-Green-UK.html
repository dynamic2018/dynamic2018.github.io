      As everyone knows, Santa Claus makes his home farther north in Finland, on a mountain called Korvatunturi. On 23 December 2008, Jason Kenney, Canada's minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, formally awarded Canadian citizenship status to Santa Claus. "The Government of Canada wishes Santa the very best in his Christmas Eve duties and wants to let him know that, as a Canadian citizen, he has the automatic right to re-enter Canada once his trip around the world is complete," Kenney said in an official statement.[5] There is also a city named North Pole in Alaska where a tourist attraction known as the "Santa Claus House" has been established. 
      His address is: Santa Claus, North Pole, Canada, H0H 0H0; no postage is required.[75] (see also: Ho ho ho). (This postal code, in which zeroes are used for the letter "O", is consistent with the alternating letter-number format of all Canadian postal codes.) Sometimes children's charities answer letters in poor communities, or from children's hospitals, and give them presents they would not otherwise receive. This was almost certainly something started by parents in more recent times, as it doesn't seem to appear in earlier versions of the story. 
      According to a recent highly reputable online review, the story gaining currency these days involves a Bavarian who came to America and fought in the Civil War. In an AP-AOL News poll, 86 percent of American adults believed in Santa as children, with the age of eight being the average for stopping to believe he is real, although 15 percent still believed after the age of ten.[1] Parental and societal encouragement of this belief is not without controversy.
