      Each letter is hand written and signed by Santa, on high quality, environmentally- friendly paper in a Christmas envelope which is guaranteed to get to your prince/ princess in time for Christmas. The year is very long and so that is a lot of things to do that I don't like! 
      Letters with multiple styles are noted on the letter ordering pages with an asterisk. Santa personalizes each letter with your child’s name, best friend's name (optional), and hometown (you can read sample letters). 
      Mail your Letter to Santa by December 14. (The deadline for schools is December 2.) Don’t worry about postage, letters addressed to Santa do not need a stamp. When you click on the templates you'll be able to see the letter template below to help you choose which one you want to give to your child.
