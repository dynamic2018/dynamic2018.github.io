      Now I know he was the soccer coach, and my mother originally found his Santa Claus ad in a local newspaper "Santa Claus for hire. According to The Oxford Book of Carols, "The carol was in fact a sign ...of the emancipation of the people from the old Puritanism which had for so many centuries suppressed the dance ...denounced communal singing, and warred against the tendency of the people to disport themselves in church on the festivals." Carols and ballads arose as forms in the fifteenth century as popular music and showed the natural desire to use music in everyday life to tell stories and inspire movement.

After hearing their story, Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown, promises that he'll find homes for the Misfit Toys, Hermey opens his own dentist's office, and Donner apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph. 
      But what seems unlikely to change is kids’ continued eagerness to correspond with the jolly fellow, and adults’ continued enjoyment in playing him. The Christmas- themed streets and shops were neat.

      Edward Johnson’s idea was to replace the candles with a string of colored electric lights, which he did with eight bulky, pear-shaped bulbs on a single wire.
