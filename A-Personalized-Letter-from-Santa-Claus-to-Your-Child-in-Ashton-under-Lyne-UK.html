      The official site of Santa Claus is called "Father Frost's Mail" . Popular culture isn't any help -- many cartoons, etc. show Santa physically leaving unwrapped toys being left under the tree or in stockings (see The Island of Lost Toys, etc.) but others (ie: A Christmas Story) clearly show children unwrapping gifts from Santa. 
      I personally believe, the spirit of Christmas deserves more than that. Fithian's association with the family of Robert Carter of Nomini Hall gave him first-hand experience of how Christmas was being kept by at least that particular gentry family in 1770s Virginia. 
      Anyway, I love this story and someday would like to have a posada of my own. ...more Jan 24, 2012 Crystal rated it it was ok Shelves: children-s-lit, picture-book, holiday, caldecott 1960 Caldecott winner I enjoyed some aspects of this book very much.
