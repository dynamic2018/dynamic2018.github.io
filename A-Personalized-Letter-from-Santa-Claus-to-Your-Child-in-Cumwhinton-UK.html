"If you're going to have an ice-free Arctic and you're going to have big melts in the summertime but also limit ice recovery in the winter, you're going to have to have events like this happen."

      The use of greenery in celebrations had a long history, as it was prominent in midwinter festivals in Babylonian, Egyptian, and Druidic cultures.[15] For the Romans evergreens were symbolic of fertility and regeneration.[16] The use of the evergreen tree in Christmas celebrations spread throughout Europe and eventually made its way to the United States, in large part through the Pennsylvania Dutch in the early 19th century.[17] The Christmas tree has traditionally been extravagantly decorated, with gifts, toys, sweets, and other ornaments hung on the tree, though now we often find gifts under the tree.[18] In the United States, the trees of choice have traditionally included the balsam fir, Douglas fir, white pine and Scotch pine.[19] Gifts Though holiday giving was an old custom, the giving of gifts at Christmas is a fairly recent innovation for Americans, the earliest account coming from German immigrants in Pennsylvania in 1745.[20] Puritans did not often exchange gifts, though exceptions are sometimes found.

What is Santa's address?
