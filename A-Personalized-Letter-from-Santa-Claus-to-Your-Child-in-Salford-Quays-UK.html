      E EmilyEileen0609 I'm still pregnant, but when I was a kid, my parents gave me the big stuff that was too big for elves to wrap, and Santa's gifts were always wrapped in special paper. But after the Protestant Reformation, saints like Nicholas fell out of favor across much of northern Europe. "That was problematic," Bowler said. "You still love your kids, but now who is going to bring them the gifts?" Bowler said that, in many cases, that job fell to baby Jesus, and the date was moved to Christmas rather than December 6. "But the infant's carrying capacity is very limited, and he's not very scary either," Bowler said. "So the Christ child was often given a scary helper to do the lugging of presents and the threatening of kids that doesn't seem appropriate coming from the baby Jesus." Some of these scary Germanic figures again were based on Nicholas, no longer as a saint but as a threatening sidekick like Ru-klaus (Rough Nicholas), Aschenklas (Ashy Nicholas), and Pelznickel (Furry Nicholas).

      Can't ya read?!" and bops the detective on the head.     Real Life  The mythology of Santa Claus originated from the very real, very mortal Saint Nicholas, a Turkish Bishop from the fourth century that performed miracles and gave gifts in secret.
