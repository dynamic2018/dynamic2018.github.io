Voting NO ensures that I and many other patients can have safe, well-regulated, and local access to a dispensary in North Pole. 
      I've been getting a great deal of spam recently attempting to get me to purchase custom letters from Santa for my children. But the miracles did not stop believing with us, and Santa Claus in distant Lapland( or where he lives there?) Did not stop waiting for our letters. 
      He and his elves then launch into a parody of "If I only had a brain." "We thought we made it all, from Barbie dolls to rubber balls / But Betsy-Wetsy took a fall. / They marked her down! / She's at the mall!" After the song ends, Dorothy laments his fate, but just then a savior shows up, hooking Santa up with a fax machine and pager (yeah, it's pretty dated, though the package does also include a cellular phone with voice messaging) Santa and his operation are saved, and Dorothy and Toto are left to lament how now he'll easily be able to check up on who's naughty and who's nice. When this eventually came to nothing, Dudley Moore suggested his friend Burgess Meredith for the role, which he in the end won.

But in the letter which you dictated there were some words which I could not make out for certain, and one or two small orders which I could not fill because we ran out of stock. 
      Once your order is placed, you can track your order to see how long it will take Santa to deliver.
