      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 99 Next page Ad feedback Product description Animated Santa Claus sings "Shake It Up Santa" and dances to the music. 
      According to The Oxford Book of Carols, "The carol was in fact a sign ...of the emancipation of the people from the old Puritanism which had for so many centuries suppressed the dance ...denounced communal singing, and warred against the tendency of the people to disport themselves in church on the festivals." Carols and ballads arose as forms in the fifteenth century as popular music and showed the natural desire to use music in everyday life to tell stories and inspire movement. They also portray Scrooge's neglected fiancée Belle, who ends their relationship after she realises that Scrooge will never love her as much as he loves money.
