      Please be sure to hang your stocking and be in bed early as Christmas is such a busy day! This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man.[29] Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, the professor of English literature, considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge's lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty "is something of a self-parody of Dickens's fears about himself"; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.[30] Scrooge could also be based on two misers: the eccentric John Elwes, MP,[31] or Jemmy Wood, the owner of the Gloucester Old Bank who was also known as "The Gloucester Miser".[32] According to the sociologist Frank W. 
      Of course Santa Claus knows if you have been naughty or nice (but I'm sure it does not hurt to remind Santa how nice you have been to your parents, siblings and friends). All of my friends have it and they won't let me play with them until I have one too!

      However, Frost's ultimate goal is to trick Santa into renouncing his position.The name Santa Claus evolved from Nick’s Dutch nickname, Sinter Klaas, a shortened form of Sint Nikolaas (Dutch for Saint Nicholas). 
      Essayist David Sedaris is known for the satirical SantaLand Diaries he kept while working as an elf in the Macy's display, which were turned into a famous radio segment and later published. As the procession moved through the streets he could hear the kids in the crowds chanting, "Here comes Santa Claus." This simple chant would linger with Gene Autry and lay the groundwork to his composition (with Oakley Haldeman) of the Christmas classic song, Here Comes Santa Claus, in 1947. 
      If you would prefer your business to have a more traditional letter-type approach, and you would like to add stickers and reindeer poop to your letters instead of photos of the children, then this would be a better option for you. Santa's secret home was revealed in 1927 on the popular Finnish Children's Hour radio show by Uncle Markus, Markus Rautio.  Uncle Markus explained about the special mountain called Korvatunturi or Ear Mountain.  The mountain looks like a big set of rabbit ears.  Of course, the elves figured out long ago how to use the ears to listen to which children around the world were being naughty.  North Pole,Alaska, USA In the 1940's, Santa set up a small place in Alaska.  Soon other people moved in too.  Because everyone loved Santa so much, they decided to call the area North Pole, Alaska.
