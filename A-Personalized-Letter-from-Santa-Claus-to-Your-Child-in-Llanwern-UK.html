      It was likely popularized by the line "He knows when you are sleeping; he knows when you're awake" from the song "Santa Claus is Comin' to Town." (German and Scandinavian traditions use this same idea as Scare 'em Straight Nightmare Fuel for toddlers).It's easy to use and they have a ton of templates to choose from.

Once you've found a template that you're happy with, choose your paper size (letter will work best in most instances) and border style for the paper that the letter is printed on. 
      Address the envelope for Santa's letter to the child, make the return address the North Pole, put Christmas stickers on the envelope and create a postmark that will make it appear the letter came from the North Pole. As these traditions increased in popularity, the modern trade and business linked to Christmas also grew.
