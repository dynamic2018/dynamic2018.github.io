      Before the Russian Revolution, Grandfather Frost (Ded Moroz) was a favored figure of Christmas who had adopted characteristics of proto-Santas like the Dutch Sinterklaas. "When the Soviet Union was formed, the communists abolished the celebration of Christmas and gift bringers," Bowler said. "Then in the 1930s, when Stalin needed to build support, he allowed the reemergence of Grandfather Frost not as a Christmas gift bringer but as a New Year's gift bringer," Bowler added. Rudolph's nose is shining bright as ever, so I know I won't have any trouble finding my way to your home! 
      Don’t let the magic get lost just because you’re feeling a bit pressed for time. I'm probably going to do the same thing with my twins.  G GlksBaby @ld8569 In my childhood Christmas was more about family than Santa, Christmas Eve was always the bigger deal (Italian...the fishes) and the gifts we got from each other/parents/grandparents were always the best gifts (like a bike would be a gift from my parents). 
      I can read your and your baby sister's jagged and fantastic marks without any trouble at all. They are grown in Brazil and Central America to supply Europe during autumn, winter, and spring. 
      One of the most compelling views we have of the real St. He accomplishes this feat with the aid of his elves, who make the toys in his workshop at the North Pole, and his flying reindeer, who pull his sleigh.[5][6] He is commonly portrayed as living at the North Pole and saying "ho ho ho" often.

In late November every year, Santa puts on his Saint Nicholas clothes and takes a special boat to the Netherlands.  He rides a white horse and checks to see who is being nice.

      It is believed that Nicholas was born sometime around 280 A. The USPS Santa letter answering effort started in 1912 out of the historic James Farley Post Office[67] in New York, and since 1940 has been called "Operation Santa" to ensure that letters to Santa are adopted by charitable organizations, major corporations, local businesses and individuals in order to make children's holiday dreams come true from coast to coast.[65] Those seeking a North Pole holiday postmark through the USPS, are told to send their letter from Santa or a holiday greeting card by 10 December to: North Pole Holiday Postmark, Postmaster, 4141 Postmark Dr, Anchorage, AK 99530-9998.[68] In 2006, according to the UPU's 2007 study and survey of national postal operations, France's Postal Service received the most letters for Santa Claus or "Père Noël" with 1,220,000 letters received from 126 countries.[69] France's Postal Service in 2007 specially recruited someone to answer the enormous volume of mail that was coming from Russia for Santa Claus.[65] Other interesting Santa letter processing information, according to the UPU's 2007 study and survey of national postal operations, are:[65] Countries whose national postal operators answer letters to Santa and other end-of-year holiday figures, and the number of letters received in 2006: Germany (500,000), Australia (117,000), Austria (6,000), Bulgaria (500), Canada (1,060,000), Spain (232,000), United States (no figure, as statistics are not kept centrally), Finland (750,000), France (1,220,000), Ireland (100,000), New Zealand (110,000), Portugal (255,000), Poland (3,000), Slovakia (85,000), Sweden (150,000), Switzerland (17,863), Ukraine (5,019), United Kingdom (750,000).
