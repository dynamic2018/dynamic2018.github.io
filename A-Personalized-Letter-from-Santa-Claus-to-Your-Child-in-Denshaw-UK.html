      Saint Nicholas was known for giving gifts to the poor. Ask Santa to implement all his plans, health, luck, and perhaps some gifts. 
      I guess he deserves special attention to all the other homeless kids that don’t exist in this world. Enter the world of magical dreams with Baby Hazel. 
      Reformers suggested switching Saint Nicholas with the Christ Child (Baby Jesus) and leaving gifts on Christmas instead of the Feast Day of Nicholas. If nothing else, I hope other parents will know better how to prepare their kids' expectations for what they'll experience here or make the choice to skip it.

Alright, I’ll share my Lego shopping list with you as long as you do me a favor.  This is going to be one of those favors that actually should make you feel really good about yourself.  You need to order a Santa letter.  The process is easy and quick and you will be making some child (or children) very happy.  This is sort of like my random restaurant thing, only I will feel much better about the Santa letter surprise. 
      In order to ensure timely delivery, it is essential the envelope or package leave one's home a minimum of 15 days before the desired delivery date.

      While psychiatry (in the movie as well as in Real Life) is convinced that Emily was insane and that it was wrong of her priest to advise her to stop taking her medication, the movie makes it ambiguous whether the battle was all a matter of insanity (making the angel a Faux Empowering Entity who helped Emily destroy herself) or a real battle between spiritual forces (making the angel a Enigmatic Empowering Entity who helped Emily defeat the devil and move on to a better place). There was an abundance of lace, delicate curly wire decoration, beadwork, tinsel and other materials… often on the same ornament. 
      This was because the German ornaments were all handmade, by people who often followed ancestral glass making traditions, something that showed in their creations and continued to attract Christmas celebrants all over the world. This is usually the third paragraph, but is sometimes the second or fourth.

His motto: “Restoring America’s heart and soul.” “I haven’t heard either of the big boys talk about anything with respect to children, so I’d like to use that as a platform to insinuate my views on children, their health, safety and welfare and that’s what I meant by restoring America’s heart and soul,” Claus told the Guardian in 2012. “We have presidents and candidates and all these other politicians that are really into the whole war machine, some other things that aren’t particularly good for children in my view and I would like to see voters consider changing that.” Claus got 625 votes in 2012 (Maryland seems to be the only state that counted him) though it’s not clear that everyone who voted for him knew they were casting their ballot for a real person.
