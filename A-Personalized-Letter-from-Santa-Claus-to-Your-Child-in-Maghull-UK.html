      Parents want their children to be happy and to encourage the magic of Christmas as long as they can.  It’s not unusual for Santa letter businesses to charge as much as $10 per letter.  Of course, you may be able to find them cheaper online, but the quality of the letter leaves much to be desired.  Deliver great quality and command a better price. Folks could leave a key under the mat, but then bad guys would know exactly where to look on Christmas Eve, and they could break in and steal all the gifts. 
      However, if you’re unable to mail a letter to Santa or visit in person to drop off a letter, use our magical letter generator to let Santa know what your special youngster hopes to get this Christmas. It's never too late to start a family tradition, and the Original Letter from Santa is offered in more than two dozen styles to suit multiple occasions and circumstances, including letters specifically designed for baby's first Christmas, toddlers, adults, and non-believers, as well as for children facing tumultuous times in their lives. 
      For example, my friend Anya, asking to meet a good guy, promised that she would quit smoking. Then when I say “Good bye and a merry Christmas to my little Susie Clemens,” you must say “Good bye, good old Santa Claus, I thank you very much and please tell that little Snow Flake I will look at her star tonight and she must look down here—I will be right in the west bay window; and every fine night I will look at her star and say, ‘I know somebody up there and likeher, too.'” Then you must go down into the library and make George close all the doors that open into the main hall, and everybody must keep still for a little while. 
      Use this picture for your phone or tablet wallpaper! Santa Claus Village is open all the year round, and summer Santa visit is no less interesting and exciting than during winter holidays. 
      You can make your own magic Santa Claus key simply by adding a magic Santa key poem.

      Following the Restoration of the monarchy and with Puritans out of power in England,[108] the ban on Christmas was satirized in works such as Josiah King's The Examination and Tryal of Old Father Christmas; Together with his Clearing by the Jury (1686).[109] Reverend Paul Nedergaard, a clergyman in Copenhagen, Denmark, attracted controversy in 1958 when he declared Santa to be a "pagan goblin" (translated from Danish) after Santa's image was used on fundraising materials for a Danish welfare organization Clar, 337.

      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!A letter from Santa Claus December 5, 2007 – 7:23 pm I have a daughter who is a solid 6 years old.  She’s very loving and polite and her belief in things her parents tell her is whole-hearted.  So when mommy and daddy tell her that Santa is going to bring her presents on Christmas, she knows that he will.  Well, now Santa writes letters and my daughter is going to receive one.

      THE SHOCKER (AKA THE “PIZZA BOX SURPRISE”) With this approach, the surprise is given as a surprise. (Think gorilla jumping out of closet, only…not.)
