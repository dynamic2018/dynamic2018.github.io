      As mentioned, above, Santa Claus (as Father Christmas) appears in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe to signal that the White Witch's always-winter-never-christmas power is beginning to fade. Gift-giving is done on January 6th (the day which marks the visit of the three kings to Jesus in the manger), and is not as important as time spent with family and religious celebrations. 
      That's part of the magic for me, especially in a culture where we've become so commercialized and hooked into manufactured icons. Although it's a long journey, I am looking forward to visiting you in !! 
      And of course, every Santa letter is stamped with our trademark "Santa's Official Mail" seal and a genuine North Pole postmark. Today, this mythical character is still alive and well and is known all over the world as: Nicholas of Myra, Santa Claus or "Santa" in America. 
      See how easy it is to create a free letter from Santa and feel your heart warm as your child gets the biggest Christmas smile of all on their face. The elves and I agreed that you deserve to get something extra-special this year. 
      What?  You think you'll email Santa Claus and he'll send you cookies?  Of course, you'll get a reply -- fast as red-nosed reindeer fly!  It's as easy as going to emailSanta.com and writing your letter!  Hey, if a grumpy elf like me can do it, you can too!  (And he does give me cookies when I email him, so, HA!) Can I write a letter to Santa Claus?
