      A 2004 study found that while in general artificial trees pose little health risk from lead contamination, there do exist "worst-case scenarios" where major health risks to young children exist.[111] A 2008 United States Environmental Protection Agency report found that as the PVC in artificial Christmas trees aged it began to degrade.[112] The report determined that of the 50 million artificial trees in the United States approximately 20 million were 9 or more years old, the point where dangerous lead contamination levels are reached.[112] A professional study on the life-cycle assessment of both real and artificial Christmas trees revealed that one must use an artificial Christmas tree at least 20 years to leave an environmental footprint as small as the natural Christmas tree.[109] Religious issues[edit] A 1931 edition of the Soviet magazine Bezbozhnik, distributed by the League of Militant Atheists, depicting an Orthodox Christian priest being forbidden to cut down a tree for Christmas The Christmas tree was first used by German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strassburg in 1539, under the leadership of the Protestant Reformer, Martin Bucer.[113][114] In the United States, these "German Lutherans brought the decorated Christmas tree with them; the Moravians put lighted candles on those trees."[115][116] When decorating the Christmas tree, many individuals place a star at the top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem, a fact recorded by The School Journal in 1897.[2][117] Professor David Albert Jones of Oxford University writes that in the 19th century, it became popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of Jesus.[3] Under the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union, after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations—along with other religious holidays—were prohibited as a result of the Soviet anti-religious campaign.[118][119][120] The League of Militant Atheists encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, among them being the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays, including Easter; the League established an anti-religious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement.[121] With the Christmas tree being prohibited in accordance with Soviet anti-religious legislation, people supplanted the former Christmas custom with New Year's trees.[120][122] In 1935 the tree was brought back as New Year tree and became a secular, not a religious holiday. Around 2800 BC, Achernar was only 8 degrees from the south pole. 
      Christmas gifts are a nice tradition, a night when children sleep with enthusiasm, hoping that Santa will bring nice gifts like this child.. In addition to letters from Santa Clause templates, there are templates for every major holiday in the United States.

      Chapman and Hall issued second and third editions before the new year, and the book continued to sell well into 1844.[65] By the end of 1844 eleven more editions had been released.[66] Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.[67] It was Dickens's most popular book in the United States, and sold over two million copies in the hundred years following its first publication there.[68] The high production costs upon which Dickens insisted led to reduced profits, and the first edition brought him only £230 (equal to £21,000 in 2017 pounds[63]) rather than the £1,000 (equal to £90,000 in 2017 pounds[63]) he expected.[69] A year later, the profits were only £744, and Dickens was deeply disappointed.[59][n 12] Reception[edit] Thackeray in 1864.

      1 million letters and 39,500 e-mail on-line request forms from children in 30 different languages, including Braille.[50] In Britain it was traditional for some to burn the Christmas letters on the fire so that they would be magically transported by the wind to the North Pole.
