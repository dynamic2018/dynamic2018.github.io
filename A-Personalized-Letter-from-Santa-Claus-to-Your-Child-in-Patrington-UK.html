      Free Letter from Santa Claus · 14 ноября 2015 г. · Magic Snowballs From the North Pole Has your Child written to Santa? Add A Letter from Santa Claus to your own personal library.In 1875, Mark Twain wrote a letter to his daughter Susie, who was 3 years old at the time, which he signed "Your loving Santa Claus." You can read it in its entirety below, but first a little bit of pretext. 
      Christmas morning we always had gifts from Santa but they were smaller, less expensive items like board games, arts and craft activities, dolls, action figures. But in the letter which you dictated there were some words which I could not make out for certain, and one or two small orders which I could not fill because we ran out of stock. 
      For instance, a Bloom County story from 15 December 1981 through 24 December 1981 has Santa rejecting the demands of PETCO (Professional Elves Toy-Making and Craft Organization) for higher wages, a hot tub in the locker room, and "short broads,” with the elves then going on strike. During the winter, Santa Claus melons are imported from South America. 
      Whether you're looking for a silly and contemporary Santa or a vintage piece of Santa clip art, you should find just what you're looking for in this list.

      Promise Santa Claus to be an active, cheerful and cheerful person who strives for the best and always achieves his goals. This year, there will probably be no presents from Santa, but she's 4 months old. 
      Well, this time of year – this time we call “Christmas” – gets very busy and kind of crazy.  Everyone just focuses on “want, want, want.”  Have you been telling your Mommy and Daddy what you want for Christmas?  It’s ok to want a few things, but I’ve seen people – grown ups and kiddos – get very selfish with all the stuff they want.  They want so many things that they forget the whole reason we even have Christmas….  Jesus – God’s son who was born a long, long, long time ago… The very first “Christmas present” ever given to the whole big world. There have been four remakes of the movie, as well as a Broadway musical.
