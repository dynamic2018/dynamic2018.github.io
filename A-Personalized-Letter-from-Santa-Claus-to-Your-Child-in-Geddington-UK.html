      Santa Claus, Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Father Christmas, Kris Kringle, Santy, or simply Santa, is a gift-giving figure in various cultures who distributes presents to children, traditionally on December 24, Christmas Eve. And perhaps what made Santa more realistic is the classic reply of the editor of New York Sun in response to the 8-year old Virginia O' Hanlon's query whether there really was a Santa Claus. 
      The tradition of having a lavish family dinner as a way to celebrate Christmas was popularized by Charles Dickens in his book A Christmas Carol published in 1843. The legend of Santa Claus is based in part on the historical figure of Saint Nicholas of Myra, as well as on Norse myths associated with the god Odin, and American commercial culture. 
      We are going to surprise our kids Christmas morning with tons of Disney stuff and tell them that we are going, but not tell them what day. In later stories the helper represented the conquered Devil, who was defeated either by Odin or his assistant Nörwi, the black father of the night. 
      Then he must go back to the dining room or the china closet and take the cook with him. We hope you will use our gift – a package of seeds from the North Pole – to develop a classroom activity that captures the spirit of the program.
