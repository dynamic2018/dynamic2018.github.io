      My mom put all the wrapped presents under the tree as she got them and wrapped them. The building totally screams tourist trap, and it probably does qualify, but once you enter the shop you are transported to the North Pole and Christmas.

      Now THAT is funny!  Santa doesn't wear a dress!  He's too busy replying to children's Christmas wishes to wear a dress!  There are many different ways Santa gets those Christmas letters but I think the easiest way is to just email Santa.  Then he won't be embarrassed in case the postman comes and he IS wearing address!  And Santa's reply won't get lost in the mail either!As everyone knows, this is Santa’s busiest time of year ― and it’s tough for the big guy to answer every Christmas letter himself.  So if your kids want a letter from Santa Claus (or maybe you want one yourself!), you may have to take matters into your own hands.  The United States Postal Service has some of Santa’s helpers standing by at its Anchorage post office, ready to return letters to kids complete with a “NORTH POLE” postmark.  Here’s how it works: Have your child write a letter to Santa. The note traveled 800 miles from Lafayette, Louisiana, and landed near the town of Santa Claus, Indiana.   Goffinet’s son spotted the pink and purple princess balloon, thinking it was a dog.   “I came inside and he was yelling about going to find a dog,” Goffinet told KLAF. “He wanted to go get the dog.”    She managed to get in touch with Kéani’s mom and on Christmas morning Kéani had some special presents under her tree with a note from “Santa” himself.   “Dear, Kéani, I received your princess balloon with your wish list,” read the letter, according to KLAF.    “This is a Christmas miracle and I do believe,” Kéani’s mother told KLAF. “I believe in miracles.”     MORE ON WEATHER.A Grumpy Old Elf answers your questions about writing a letter to Santa Claus: How do I write a letter to Santa? 
      Americans persistently attempted to separate the influence of commerce from the gifts they gave. When you're ready for the big reveal, write "We're Going to Disney World" on one in big black marker! 
      You have two options: traditional letters mailed by you, or an automated card sending system. In other words, if Santa is related to shamanism, it’s very indirectly. (See Ronald Hutton, Stations of the Sun, pages 117-119.) In some parts of Scandinavia it’s possible that Thor was the more influential of the Norse gods.

      Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? The Story of Santa Claus reads more like a Tall Tale including miraculous events while focusing on some of the religious aspects surrounding the beginnings of the legend.

      If Santa were to have a nice list, then he could fulfill his supposed duty regarding naughty children under this theory, by simply omitting them from the nice list. therefore the list wouldn't even need to be called the nice list, rather he would just have a list.
