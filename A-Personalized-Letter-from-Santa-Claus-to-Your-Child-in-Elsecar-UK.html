      The reasons Christmas is popular in the United States are: retail stores make cubic tons of money; families have an excuse to get together; people can be generous in giving gifts; people will be receiving presents for just knowing someone; adults can relive being children by continuing the story and beliefs; parents can participate in the children’s fantasies of Rudolph and Santa and Elves. I can read your and your baby sister's jagged and fantastic marks without any trouble at all.
