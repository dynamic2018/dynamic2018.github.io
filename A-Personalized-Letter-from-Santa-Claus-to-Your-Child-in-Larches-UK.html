      It’s the perfect way to share the magic of the season with the children you love.A letter from Santa Claus December 5, 2007 – 7:23 pm I have a daughter who is a solid 6 years old.  She’s very loving and polite and her belief in things her parents tell her is whole-hearted.  So when mommy and daddy tell her that Santa is going to bring her presents on Christmas, she knows that he will.  Well, now Santa writes letters and my daughter is going to receive one. Now it is time to open the champagne and celebrate great overcoming. 
      Unable to afford dowries ~ money or property brought by a wife to her husband at marriage ~ for the girls, the three young women have no prospects for wedlock and may be subject to lives of shame. The elves are busy putting bows and ribbons on the last of the presents. 
      They are still in the dark as to how the custom came into practice. Like the glass ornaments, these too were a hit everywhere. 
      Scott asks where he can find Lucy and Neil, and Laura replies sharply that they have been visiting the North Pole every year since their divorce before handing him a flyer which reads "The North Pole Resort", which Scott immediately recognizes as Jack's handiwork.
