What is Santa's address?

      Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time! Although the size of a gift is not what counts, in this time it is a large gift, really great that almost completely cover the child.
