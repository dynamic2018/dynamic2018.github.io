But it takes a lot MORE magic to do it without a key, and on Christmas Even he needs every bit of Christmas spirit to make sure the reindeer and sleigh can make it all around the world.) So now, any time Santa wants to get into a home without a chimney (and even some homes WITH chimneys because it's so much easier to go through the door), he simply looks for a special key left near the door or hanging around the doorknob with a note for him.
