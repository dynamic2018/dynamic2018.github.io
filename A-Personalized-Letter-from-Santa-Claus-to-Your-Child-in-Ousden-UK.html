      After the kids fall asleep on Christmas Eve, add the gifts from Santa to the very front of your tree skirt to make it appear like good old Saint Nick came down the chimney that very night. Why?  What letter would you like?  I know when you write Santa he likes the letters C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S!  Oh, for a grumpy old elf, I sure am funny!  (Well, at least *I* think I am, so there!)  I know he uses those letters quite a bit when he replies back to emails at emailSanta.com.  So, if you want a letter from Santa you could always send him one there.  Just make sure you tell him which letter you'd like back (I'd at least ask for a letter that's made of chocolate if I was you!) What is Santa's address? 
      Some kids choose to email Santa but he’s a traditional Old Elf and still loves handwritten letters from good kids like you! There's no South Star that works in the same vein as this star, however, the constellation of Crux (aka the Southern Cross) does point in the direction of the South Pole. 
      This was traditionally considered a lucky day to make large purchases or to get married. Is it your hope that the adults will learn something from Ellis’ exploits too? 
      Then you must go up to the nursery and stand on a chair or the nurse's bed and put your ear to the speaking tube that leads down to the kitchen and when I whistle through it you must speak in the tube and say, "Welcome, Santa Claus!" Then I will ask whether it was a trunk you ordered or not. If at all possible, we will make sure that children on the same order get different letters. 
      Surprise your kids with a trip to Disney right now!
