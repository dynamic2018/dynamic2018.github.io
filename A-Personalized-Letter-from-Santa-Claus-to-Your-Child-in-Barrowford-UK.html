So, though Massachusetts had had a state-supported church until 1833 and it’s likely that many workers in the predominantly Christian society would have taken the day off anyway, the effort to pass the law came from commercial lobbies rather than religious groups. “When that legislature declared Christmas to be a legal holiday, they included a proviso that, when Christmas happened to fall on a Sunday, the following Monday would become the legal holiday.

      Santa authentic down to 13-year-old beard By Dan Rice, Staff Writer After thirty-two round trips on the Alaska Highway, a 29-year stint as a cook at Clear Air Force Station and more than 40 years in Alaska, Collie Collins seems the proudest about another enduring aspect of himself. "That's real; that's 13 years old," he said to a visitor of the Santa Claus House in North Pole last week who couldn't resist testing whether Santa's beard is just part of a costume.

      His Santa looked similar to the Wild Men of legend in Europe (essentially boogie-men living outside of society), but less scary. Did you think you could write a letter to Santa Claus and get TWO back?  That's just silly!  You almost made this grumpy elf laugh with that one!  Of course, you can write Santa as many times as you want at emailSanta.com and he'll reply to each and every one.  BUT, I'm pretty sure he'll just send one letter back each time! 
      Perhaps one should not over analyse these things - although there are grey areas, most of us will recognise a carol for what it is, and most of us will enjoy the sound we hear. Another year, the Doorman (DeMarr David), who had recently been drafted as the Avatar of Oblivion, encountered Santa and asked him for a Christmas miracle for his dad: "Some toy he'd always longed for ever since he was a kid, something to teach him the true meaning of Christmas and help forge a bond between father and son?" Unfortunately, as Christmas Eve was Santa's busiest time of year, he didn't have time to help out Doorman, though later he was able to join Doorman and his teammates (then the GLX/Great Lakes X-Men) on their Christmas celebration.[citation needed] Powers and Abilities Powers Santa Claus has a number of magical abilities, including longevity, the ability to fit himself and others through any chimney (avoiding fiery injury in the process), levitate up a chimney (usually by touching his nose and nodding), alter the appearance of himself or other objects or beings (including physically transforming a person into an inanimate object), change the size of other objects, teleport himself and others across the world, generate snow and determine who has been naughty or nice. 
      Each letter is printed on beautiful paper made by Santa himself using smudge and smear-proof ink that will last a lifetime, and comes in an envelope that is also designed by Santa.Sadly, Wenceslas's life ended when he was assassinated by his brother, but after his death he was viewed as a martyr and canonised for his piety and goodness. 
      Special ones have lights, motors, or are interactive, making them a treat to see on the tree. Santa would still love to receive individual letters from your students, or one letter written together.

      His motto: “Restoring America’s heart and soul.” “I haven’t heard either of the big boys talk about anything with respect to children, so I’d like to use that as a platform to insinuate my views on children, their health, safety and welfare and that’s what I meant by restoring America’s heart and soul,” Claus told the Guardian in 2012. “We have presidents and candidates and all these other politicians that are really into the whole war machine, some other things that aren’t particularly good for children in my view and I would like to see voters consider changing that.” Claus got 625 votes in 2012 (Maryland seems to be the only state that counted him) though it’s not clear that everyone who voted for him knew they were casting their ballot for a real person.

      The official site of Santa Claus is called "Father Frost's Mail" . Parents left their notes to children by the fireplace, or in one of the nearby stockings, and soon children put their replies to him there. 
      Santa is mostly portrayed as a jolly, fat, white-bearded man dressed in a red coat with black boots who laughs, "Ho, ho, ho". But after the Protestant Reformation, saints like Nicholas fell out of favor across much of northern Europe. "That was problematic," Bowler said. "You still love your kids, but now who is going to bring them the gifts?" Bowler said that, in many cases, that job fell to baby Jesus, and the date was moved to Christmas rather than December 6. "But the infant's carrying capacity is very limited, and he's not very scary either," Bowler said. "So the Christ child was often given a scary helper to do the lugging of presents and the threatening of kids that doesn't seem appropriate coming from the baby Jesus." Some of these scary Germanic figures again were based on Nicholas, no longer as a saint but as a threatening sidekick like Ru-klaus (Rough Nicholas), Aschenklas (Ashy Nicholas), and Pelznickel (Furry Nicholas).
